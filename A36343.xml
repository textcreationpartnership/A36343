            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For that which is impertinent, whether ſo really, or in opinion only, whilſt ſo apprehended, is a nuyſance, or offence unto men: whereas that which is neceſſary, is an eaſe and convenience. The number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe variety of <hi>Catechiſms</hi> already extant in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, ſcarce leaves a place in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many to judge this neceſſary: any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto fulneſſe, ſeemeth rather a ſuperfluity. Though theſe Papers entituled, <hi>A Door opening into Chriſtian Religion</hi> are drawn up by way of queſtion and anſwer after the manner of a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, yet is it much larger and more fuller than ordinarily ſuch things are. The great Doctrines herein treated of, will be found by conſidering perſons very Chriſtian, Evangelical, truly comporting and agreeing with the Scriptures, and are very proper to build men up in their moſt holy Faith, and to promote the power of Godlineſſe in their hearts and lives: And upon theſe accounts, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to cauſe them to be printed for publike bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, having no other deſign in my eye, but the honour
<pb facs="tcp:43506:3"/> of God, and the general good of mankind. It is poſſible here may be ſome things treated of, both for matter and manner which ordinarily are not found in other pieces of this nature; yet (I preſume) thou mayſt aſſure thy ſelf, that they all conſpire together to make thee compleat in the true and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the great Myſteries of thy ſalvation. It is true, this piece of Catechiſm (if ſo thou pleaſeſt to call it) is moulded and contrived in the nature of a Directory, Guide, or Aſſiſtant unto Maſters of Families, Parents, and Inſtructors of Youth, to put them into a way, and to furniſh them with matter, for the ſeaſoning of the greener years and weaker capacities of thoſe under them, with ſaving knowledge, rather then to be immediatly propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto children, or ſuch as are capable of feeding upon milk only, or to be impoſed upon theſe to be learned and underſtood, without the help of ſome more able to explain now and then, ſome words and paſſages unto them. Notwithſtanding great care hath been taken for perſpicuity and plainneſſe in the framing and carrying of all things in it: only the matter riſing ſometimes more ſpiritual then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, may have occaſioned ſome degree of obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, at leaſt to underſtandings not ſo expert, or <hi>skilful</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>in the word of righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good Reader, I ſhall detain thee no longer by the way, only wiſhing that the ſpirit of the little body now in thy hand, were in thy heart and ſoul, being fully aſſured, that it would both quicken and ſtrengthen thee in thine approaches unto God.</p>

                     <p>To the former part of this Queſtion, The Anſwer ought to be Affirmative: to the latter, Negative. The Doctrine of the Trinity (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Queſtion) is to be believed, as being frequently inſinuated, and ſometimes plainly enough delivered and expreſſed in the Scriptures: So that it hath as much in Argument and Proof, and as many Reaſons for the Confirmation of its truth, as the Scriptures themſelves have to evince their Authority to be divine, and their deſcent from God.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, This Doctrine of the Trinity, doth ſo marvellouſly accommodate, and gives that credit and countenance to the great myſtery of the Goſpel, (I mean, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and deſign of God for the ſalvation of the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) that it would

For neither would that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſalvation of the world, which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his death, be rational enough to become the wiſdome and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, unleſs it were ſuppoſed, and taken for granted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly, and by nature God: Nor would the work of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification which is aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt, the manner and terms conſidered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which it is aſcribed unto him, be at all probable, or likely to ſubdue the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men unto it, unleſs they ſhall firſt believe, or underſtand, that he alſo is truly God.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it a Teſtimony of ſlender value unto the Doctrine of the Trinitie, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the Chriſtian Church, famous both for learning and piety, have ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, all along from the times as near to the Apoſtles as any authentique record will lead us unto, and with ſo little, and ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a difference in judgment amongſt them about ſo great a myſtery, expounded the Scriptures in perfect conſonancie to the ſaid Doctrine. And this Teſtimonie of theirs, in the caſe in hand, is ſo much the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and weighty, becauſe it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (as in ſome other points it may, yea and in ſome, is) that in this Argument they did <hi>ſecuritis bequi,</hi> ſpake, or wrote, leſſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, or conſiderately as having none
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43506:7"/> to queſtion, or oppoſe them, in what they did deliver therein. For they had ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts upon the account of this Doctrine, as with the <hi>Arrians, Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> and their Diſciples.

Yea Idolatry being one of thoſe ſins, which, without Repentance, excludeth from the Kingdome of God (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.15.) it cannot well be conceived, how any of them ſhould be ſaved, in caſe it be ſuppoſed that they lived and dyed worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſervers, of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And the truth is, that he had need have a very high eſteem of his own underſtanding, and a confident perſwaſion of much more then ordinary in it, that ſhall undertake to prove, or conclude, that the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world (upon the matter, and an inconſiderable number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only excepted) both teachers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for ſo many ages together as have paſſed over the world ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> was firſt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as God, lived and dyed under the guilt of that Soul-deſtroying ſin of Idolatry.

                     <p n="1">1. The Divine nature, or being, differing on the right hand <hi>plùs quam toto genere,</hi> more then by the whole <hi>genus,</hi> from all created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings whatſoever, and being ſupertranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and incomprehenſibly, excellent above the moſt perfect and excellent of theſe, it is but reaſonable to conceive that the manner of it's ſubſiſting ſhould be proportionable, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the unparallable dignity of this Being; and conſequently, that it ſhould have no communion with the manner, according unto which any created nature, or being what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſubſiſteth. Upon which account it muſt needs be unconceiveable, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by any created or finite underſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is moſt agreeable unto reaſon that the Divine nature, or God, ſhould ſubſiſt in ſuch a manner, or upon ſuch termes, wherein he might enjoy himſelf in the greateſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contentment that can be imagined; Yea in ſuch contentment, that infinitely ſurpaſſeth the imaginations of men. Nor doth it bear hard upon any principle in reaſon to conceive, that it ſhould be matter of contentment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God or unto the Divine nature, or being, to ſubſiſt in three, equally partaking all the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential attributes and perfections of it; yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43506:9"/> really diſtinct one from the other in relative Conſiderations or Properties. For by this means, God, or the Divine nature, thus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in three, equal in knowledg, equal in underſtanding, in goodneſs, holineſs, and all Divine qualifications and perfections, may well be apprehended to enjoy himſelf upon termes beſt agreeable unto his nature, I mean in a way of a divine and meet ſociety, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Communion.

                     <p>Why the Divine nature, or eſſence ſhould ſubſiſt in three, and neither in more nor in few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and ſo, why the firſt in order of the three, ſhould make himſelf known by the relation of a Father; The ſecond, by the relation of a Son; The third and laſt, by the appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit, (with ſome other heights, and depths belonging to this myſtery) though ſome have eſſayed to give an account; yet full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

                     <p n="3">3. Some diligent ſearchers into the hidden things of nature, have with much confidence affirmed, that in ſeveral of theſe they have diſcovered and obſerved the expreſs foot-ſteps of the Trinity, and have found plain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters repreſenting their Creatour as One in Three.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some ancient and learned Philoſophers, and Poets, amongſt the Heathen, have utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeveral ſayings, though in ſomewhat an obſcure broken and indiſtinct manner, by which notwithſtanding it ſufficiently appears that they had ſome impreſſions upon their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of the ſubſiſting of the firſt and ſupream Being, in Three: who yet conſtantly maintained the oneneſſe of this being.

                     <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) Neither is it credible, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſo unparalleld a pattern of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſelf-denial, would have uttered with his own mouth ſuch expreſſions from time to time as the Goſpel aſcribeth unto him; by

Nor is it any whit more worthy belief, that the Holy Ghoſt, being the appropriate, inditer of the body of the Scriptures, ſhould prompt his holy <hi>Amanuenſes,</hi> or Penmen, with ſo many ſayings as ſtand upon record here, by which the minds and judgments of ſo many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dear friends of God, ſhould be ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, ſo potently drawn as they have been, into ſo groſs, ſo foul, ſo dangerous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive an errour, as to believe him to be truly God, and conſequently to worſhip and glorifie him as God indeed, if it be ſuppoſed, that, notwithſtanding all that he cauſed to be written upon the account of his own Honour and Dignity in this kind, yet he was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf that he was but <hi>nihili nepos,</hi> of kin unto nothing, and of the creature race. Doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt, had he been a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though an Angel, though an Arch-Angel, and of an order nigheſt unto God himſelf, would upon an occaſion of any thing ſaid by him that might with the leaſt probability in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to think he were God, and ſo to worſhip him, have rather cautioned them to take heed of ſuch a ſnare, then leave it in

For this is recorded by him to have been the genius and manner of thoſe excellent Creatures, the Angels; I mean, to take men off from worſhipping, or aſcribing divine honour unto them. See <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.8, 9. Therefore certainly the Doctrine of the Trinity as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught? and believed, by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth nothing in it that needs offend the minds reaſons; or conſciences of any men.</p>

                        <hi>Whether is it ſafe, or meet, to uſe the word Perſon when we ſpeak of the Trinity, or of the three ſubſiſting in the Divine nature, as to ſay; There is one God and three Perſons?</hi>

                     <p>Although the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> is not found uſed in the Scriptures about the matter in hand (as neither is the word <hi>Trinity</hi>) yet may it conveniently enough, and without offence, be applyed to any of the three ſubſiſting in the divine nature. For by a <hi>Perſon</hi> is only meant an intellectual <hi>Individuum,</hi> or one who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh with others in ſome intellectual nature, yet is diſtinct in his being or ſubſiſting from all thoſe, with whom he thus partaketh.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43506:11"/> in a differing and diſtinct manner from them. Thus God the Father ſubſiſteth in the ſame intellectual nature, with the Son, and with the Spirit [or the Holy Ghoſt]; but after a different and diſtinct manner from them both, as, <hi>viz.</hi> in relation of a Father, or as genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Son; in which propriety, or manner of ſubſiſting, neither of the other two partake with him. In this reſpect he may be ſaid to be a <hi>Perſon.</hi> In like manner, the ſecond (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) of the three ſubſiſting in the ſame intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual nature with the Father and the Spirit, but after a manner appropriate to himſelf, as <hi>viz.</hi> in the relation of a Son, or one begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, may be termed a <hi>Perſon</hi> alſo. There is the ſame conſideration of the third, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be termed a <hi>Perſon</hi> becauſe he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſame nature with the other two, but in a manner peculiar to himſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> as proceeding from the other two by way of Spiration.</p>

For that Humane Body, and Humane Soul, which He aſſumed, was no Perſon of Mankind, nor did they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubſiſt of, or by themſelves, or apart from his God-head; only his aſſuming and uniting them unto his Divine Perſon, made this of a conſideration by it ſelf, far differing from all other perſons, ſubſiſting, either in the one nature, or the other; I mean, either in the Divine Nature, or Humane.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, There being a world of men that had provoked God, the death or anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of an Angel; or of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43506:21"/> though perſonally united to an Angel, (if ſuch a thing could, or ſhould, be ſuppoſed) would have been a Sacrifice of no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Balance in the Eye of Juſtice, to make an attonement for ſuch a vaſt number of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo conſiderable, as Men are.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly), The Honour and Dignity in Equity belonging to ſo great an Undertaking, proſperouſly atchieved and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as the Salvation of a loſt World, were too high and glorious an Inveſtiture for the greateſt of Angels, and only becoming the only begotten Son of God.

                        <hi>But though it be granted that the Incarnation of the Son of God was neceſſary for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation of the World; yet whether was it neceſſary that he ſhould be conceived and born of a Virgin, and not in the ordinary way of natural Propagation?</hi>

                     <p>There may be ſeveral reaſons why it ſhould be neceſſary, or at leaſt why it ſhould be more expedient, and better becoming the Wiſdom of God, that he ſhould be born of a Virgin, then according to the courſe of ordinary Propagation. Of which reaſons one of the chief may be this: It being the will and pleaſure of God to involve <hi>Adam</hi>'s whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity [<hi>viz.</hi> which ſhould according to the courſe of nature deſcend from him, and which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43506:22"/> was <hi>ſeminally,</hi> in his Loyns] in the guilt of his firſt ſin, and condemnation due thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; it was neceſſary that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be conceived and born in a way beſides the courſe of Nature, that ſo he might be born free from this guilt and condemnation, and ſo be in a due capacity to make attonement for thoſe, that were lyable unto them.</p>

                     <p>I ſuppoſe, to accommodate and relieve the infirmity, or weakneſs, both of the Faith, and of the fleſh of men.

                     <p>The death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is able to ſave men, that is, hath a complete ſaving efficacy in it, whether men believe or no. Yet this ſaving efficacy of it taketh place in no man, unleſs he believeth (if by years and diſcetion, he be capable of believing.) Nevertheleſſe that which giveth unto it the actual efficacy of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe that do believe, is not their Faith or believing, but the authority of the gracious Decree or appointment of God, wherein he hath ordained, that all thoſe ſhall be ſaved by the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that ſhall believe.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43506:26"/> nor (indeed) the ſalvation of any man, any otherwiſe, or upon any other terms, then only in caſe they ſhall believe.

                     <p>It was not ſimply, and barely the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, or the expiation of ſin, which God intended by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of both upon the moſt honourable terms, both for his wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt ſin. Therefore though it might be a queſtion, or matter of doubt, whether ſome under-ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> might not have effected the Redemption of the world, ſimply conſidered, or without any breach made upon equity; yet it can be neither, but that the death it ſelf of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was neceſſary hereunto, in that way of effecting, or procuring it, which was only pleaſing in the ſight of God. And it is a clear caſe that God's juſt ſeverity againſt ſin, could not have been ſo fully manifeſted by any lighter ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as now it hath been by his Death.</p>

                        <hi>But if</hi> Chriſt <hi>by his death fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God for the ſin of man, or of mankind, how cometh it to paſſe that men themſelves, yea believers, as well as others, are puniſhed by him with death, and with many other afflictions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Satisfaction?</hi>

                     <p>Although Death, with the ſad retinew of other Sufferings, at firſt came into the world upon the account, and by means of, ſin already committed; and came in the nature and notion of puniſhments for it; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his ſatisfaction hath ſo altered the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, that they are not now properly puniſhments for ſin committed, (though ſin committed may occaſion, or cauſe them to be inflicted by God; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30.) but chaſtiſements to prevent the commiſſion of ſin, and ſo to prepare and render them meet for ſalvation; being inflicted, though juſtly, yet not out of juſtice, but out of love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43506:27"/> by God. See and compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Deu.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. (with ſome others); yea Death it ſelf, is, and may, in this reſpect, be called a Chaſtiſement, and not a puniſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it prevents further ſinning, and makes way for the Saints into their Glory. Notwithſtanding, becauſe chaſtiſements are like unto puniſhments, and the ſame in the letter, and ſubſtance with them; they may ſometimes (according to the rule, <hi>Similiae ſimilium nominibus gaudent,</hi> Things alike are oft expreſſed by the ſame names) be called, <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> as <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41.43. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. <hi>Am.</hi> 3.2. and elſewhere. So likewiſe, becauſe when they are very grievous and ſore, they are like unto the effects of wrath and anger, they are ſometimes aſcribed to theſe paſſions in God, as the cauſe of them. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 12.1 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.15.</p>
                     <p>Another Anſwer to the Queſtion may be; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not made by his death full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the juſtice of God for mens ſins, upon any ſuch terms, as either to indulge or harden any man in the practiſe of ſin by ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him from the ſtroak of Gods diſpleaſure when he offendeth; nor yet to deprive God of his Liberty to govern the World, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, his own houſe, the houſhold of Faith in wiſdome, righteouſneſs, and equity, and conſequently, to judge and puniſh delinquents
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43506:28"/> in either, when he ſeeth juſt cauſe; but the compleatneſs, or fulneſs of this Satisfaction, ſtandeth in this; that God may, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, without the leaſt reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diſparagement unto, his juſtice, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred of ſin, forgive all men all their ſins upon their unfeigned Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; notwithſtanding he may in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (as in that of <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Becauſe God judged this a ſufficient time, to evince and prove the truth and certainty of his death, for the full ſatisfaction of thoſe, whom it concerned to believe it; ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been thought to be dead for ſeveral hours together, who yet were not dead, but in a trance only.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe by this time (as was even now ſaid) he had ſufficiently confirmed the truth of his death, by which he had wrought
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43506:29"/> the great work of Redemption, and made attonement for the World. So that there was no further neceſſity, or occaſion of his remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the bonds of death. And it was moſt contrary to his will and pleaſure to cauſe or ſuffer, his <hi>Holy one</hi> to ſuffer impertinently, who taketh care that his ordinarie Saints be not <hi>in heavineſs,</hi> except it be when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it was the unchangeable will of God, according as it was foretold by <hi>David</hi> long before (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. compared with Acts 2.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that his <hi>Holy one,</hi> [meaning <hi>Chriſt</hi>] <hi>ſhould not ſee corruption.</hi> Now it hath been the obſervation of ſome, and is (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the judgment of more, that a dead body, after three daies lying in the Grave, begins to putrifie and corrupt; which ſeemeth alſo, by that ſaying of <hi>Martha</hi> (concerning the interred body of her Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Lord, <hi>by this time he ſtinketh:</hi> for he hath been dead four daies <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.39.) to have been received for truth among the <hi>Jewes.</hi> So that God, to keep his <hi>Holy one</hi> in the grave longer then three daies, from <hi>ſeeing Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> muſt have wrought a Miracle, and not long after another Miracle greater then that, <hi>viz.</hi> in raiſing him from the dead.

                     <p>
                        <hi>But if the death of</hi> Chriſt <hi>was only temporal, and of no longer Continuance then three dayes, and three nights, how can it be a reaſonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to the juſtice, or juſt ſeveritie of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, which required the eternal death of ſo many millions as ſhould ſin?</hi>

                     <p>To this Queſtion, Anſwer hath in part been given formerly, where it was (in effect) ſaid, that, the infinite dignity of the perſon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it was altogether as high ah act, or as high an expreſſion of Gods juſt hatred and ſeverity againſt ſin, not to abſolve thoſe, or any of thoſe, that had ſinned, but only upon the account of the death, yea be it but of the temporal death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as it would have been to have puniſhed all, and every one of the ſaid ſinners, with death eternal. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which this may be added; that it was not eternal death, as ſuch (I mean, as Eternal) which the juſtice of God required of thoſe that ſhould ſin, or had ſinned, but death ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; <hi>In that day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die</hi> [or, according to the Hebrew, dying thou ſhalt die] <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. This death (indeed) conſequentially, and (as it were) by accident, would have been eternal, <hi>viz.</hi> through the weakneſs and inability of the creature, on whom it was to be inflicted, being not able to deliver it ſelf from it. For if (for argument ſake) it could be ſuppoſed,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43506:30"/> that any creature, on which God ſhall inflict death for ſin, (be it that death which we call temporal) could recover it ſelf from under this death, or reſtore it ſelf unto life again, it is not reaſonable to think that God would puniſh this creature with another death, or inflict death upon it the ſecond time, for that ſin, for which the firſt death was inflicted. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (I conceive) inſinuates this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he ſaith (though by way of alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that <hi>he that is dead</hi> [or, that hath died, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So that the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though but temporal, yet is, not only upon a geometrical, or upon an equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account, but even upon an arithmetical, ſtrict, or literal account, a full compenſation to the juſtice of God againſt ſin uttering it ſelf in that threatning, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi>

                     <p>Yes: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teacheth us, that he was raiſed again [<hi>viz.</hi> from death] for our juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. which the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43506:30"/> Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> interprets, at leaſt in part, where he ſaith, that <hi>God raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your Faith and Hope might be in God.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.21. And the former Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith; <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen then is our preaching vain, and your Faith is alſo vain.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.14.17. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, or been deteyned by God, in the priſon of Death, it would have argued that he had failed, or fallen ſhort, in giving that ſatisfaction unto the juſtice of God for ſin, which was undertaken by him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there could have been no ſufficient ground for any man to believe in God for the forgiveneſſe of his ſins upon the account of his death; without which Faith, there can be no juſtification. Whereas his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by God from his impriſonment in death, effectually proveth that he had made full payment unto him of that debt, which he had taken upon himſelf to diſcharge. And upon this account there is firm footing for every man to expect by Faith the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſins at the hand of God.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, It is an higher ground, or larger foundation, whereon to build our Faith, and Hope in God, then his Reſurrection: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it more fully argueth and confirmeth, that he was very highly ſatisfied and pleaſed with his Death for the Sin and Salvation of Men; inaſmuch as it was upon, and for, this ſervice performed, that he ſo highly dignified and exalted him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. compared, <hi>Who by him do believe in God, who raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your Faith and Hope might be in God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.21. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It much enliveneth and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our comfort about the effectualneſs and ſucceſs of his Interceſſion for us. The more he is honoured and advanced by God, the higher he muſt needs be conceived to be in grace and favour with him: and according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, his prevalency with him in all his motions and applications unto him, muſt in reaſon be eſtimated and believed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The excellency of the glory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is advanced by God, renders the Goſpel ſo much the more authoritative, and awful, in and over the hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men; and makes the neglect of it, and every ſin committed againſt it, the more deteſtable and threatning. For, what can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be judged a greater abomination, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43506:34"/> more provoking in the ſight of God, then for that ſilly creature called <hi>Man,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, or neglect him, whom he, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Heaven and Earth, hath judged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that unconceiveable weight of Glory, which he hath laid upon him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly (and laſtly), It highly commends his ſervice to the Judgements and Souls of Men, making it the moſt rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ingagement unto the Intellectual Creature, of all others. <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) [<hi>ſeek the face</hi> [or favour] <hi>of the Ruler,</hi> (Prov. 29.26.) which ſheweth it to be very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of fleſh and bloud ſo to do. And the greater in place, and power any Ruler is, the hearts of men are ſo much the more inclinable, and eaſily drawn, to ſeek his favour, eſpecially when they have any promiſing Dore of Hope open before them, that by ſeeking they may obtain it. Therefore the ſupertranſcendent greatneſs of the Glory and Power wherin <hi>Chriſt</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is of excellent conſequence and import to <hi>draw all men unto</hi> him, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32.) to perſwade the world to ſeek his favour, and to work their hearts to ſo much the more readineſs and willingneſs to accept of his moſt gracious offer to entertain them in his ſervice, if they deſire it.</p>

According to this notion, the Interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we ſpeak of, is deſcribed to be, His appearance in the preſence <hi>of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. And his being <hi>at the right hand of God,</hi> [that is, his great Dignity and Glory given unto him by God] is mentioned as precedaneous to his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43506:35"/> Interceſſion, and making way for, or giving efficacy unto it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.</p>

                     <p>Look what mercies, favours, and good things the one ſort of theſe men receive from God, and what the other receive like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and by this it may be known with what difference Chriſt Intercedes for the one and for the other. For certain it is, that what grace, mercy, favour, or good ſoever, is ſhewed by God unto the world, (I mean, unto perſons of all characters, whether of righteouſneſs, or of ſin, reſpectively) is the genuine fruit of the Interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For, it is for his ſake, and by means of his mediation, that the iniquity of the world is not every moment the ruine of it. So that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> intercedes on the behalf of his Saints, that their infirmities and weakneſſes may make no breach between his Father and them; that God will inable them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to continue in Faith and Love unto the end, that he will afford them ſufficient means for their ſpiritual Edification, that he will ſupply them with all things needful for this preſent life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, on the behalf of other men, yet ſinful and unconverted, he Intercedes that a larger ſpace of Repentance may be granted unto them, that God will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43506:36"/> give them ſufficient means for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and making themſelves new hearts, [<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31.]; that of ſome of them God will fill their hearts with food and gladneſs, that hereby they may be provoked to love him, and believe on him for greater things; that unto others of them he will adminiſter ſeaſonable corrections, by which they may be admoniſhed to look up unto him, and ſeek after him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in his Wiſdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Goodneſs in the Government of the World, he ſhall judge beſt, and moſt for his glory, and that obſtinate and careleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be left without excuſe in the day of Judgement.</p>

The Sentence which is then executed both upon the one, and the other, is, only that which was long ſince threatned againſt (and ſo conditionally paſſed upon) all fleſh, in caſe of ſin; <hi>viz. In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death,</hi> Gen. 2.7. The execution of which Sentence or Threatning, after ſin commited, is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and without condition, threatned, and the Sentence it ſelf interpreted, in theſe words; <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto it thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen 3.19. However there may be ſeveral weighty reaſons given, why God ſhould appoint a day, or a time, for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgement of the World; more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially three.</p>

                     <p>There are many things, which may be wrought out of the Scriptures, and deduced from them, by the bleſſing of God upon a conſcientious, diligent, and dexterous inquiry after them, which yet are hid ſo deep in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious

So that for a man to be juſtified from his ſins, is to be exempted by God from amongſt thoſe that are liable to death and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for their ſins, and to be numbred amongſt thoſe that are heirs of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                     <p>Farre be it from us to think that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth any perſon of mankind from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation</hi> purchaſed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the non-performance of things unpoſſible unto them, or that he ſhould eſtimate any of them according to that they have not, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which they have. Therefore although the Scriptures ſpeak nothing ſo expreſly either of the juſtification, or Salvation, either of Infants or of Idiots, as they doe both of the juſtification, and Salvation, of men and women, who believe; Yet that as well the one, as the other are both juſtified,

                     <p>Juſtification is ſometimes taken for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a mans Faith, [that is, either for the making of a ſufficient proof of the truth and ſoundneſſe thereof; or elſe for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43506:45"/> giving of a teſtimony, whether by word or by deed, unto the truth of it] and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the juſtification or approbation of the Perſon himſelf. For he that juſtifieth, or approveth any mans faith as ſound and good, in a conſequential ſenſe, juſtifieth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the perſon himſelf, at leaſt in reſpect of his faith, and of all things depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such a juſtification as this is proper unto works [that is, unto ſuch works, which give a due and ſufficient proof of the ſoundneſſe of a mans faith] and is accordingly in Scripture attributed unto them. In this ſenſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>juſtified by works, when he had offered</hi> Iſaac <hi>his Son upon the altar. Iam.</hi> 2.21. that is, to have received ſuch a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from God, which did amount to the juſtification of his Faith, as ſincere and ſound; and conſequently of his Perſon alſo. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17, 18. But concerning the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mans perſon, ſtrictly and properly ſo called, and which (as was lately ſaid) ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in remiſſion of ſins, Faith only, and not works, hath to do in the obtaining of it from God. And in this ſenſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his offering up his Son upon the Altar. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.9.10.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet on the other ſide it is true again, that Faith ſhall never obtain that full benefit or fruition of that juſtification, which it alone obtaineth (I mean, the great bleſſing of Salvation) without the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43506:46"/> and Co-operation of works with it (as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.22.) And in this reſpect the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, when he ſaith, that <hi>not the Hearers</hi> [that is, not thoſe that are only hearers] <hi>of the Law, but the doers of the Law,</hi> [that is, the conſcientious obſervers of it, though not without many ſlips and frailties] <hi>ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> [that is, ſhall enjoy the great benefit of juſtification the ſaving of their ſouls]. Take the word, Juſtification in any of the Senſes now mentioned, it may truly be ſaid to be of <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe God was at perfect liberty whether ever he would have juſtified man being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, or any perſon that had ever ſinned in one kind or other, either by faith or by works, or in any other way whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What works are they, which are ſufficient to juſtifie a mans Faith, or to render him actually capable of Salvation?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſaid (as we lately heard) that <hi>Abraham was juſtified by works, when he offered</hi> Iſaack <hi>his Son upon the altar. Iam.</hi> 2. 22. So that it ſeems that in perſons profeſſing faith in God, any notable or ſingular ſtrain, or act, of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience unto him, is ſufficient for ſuch a ſervice, I mean to juſtifie the faith of ſuch a man. Otherwiſe a conſcientious and uniforme obſervance of the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, expreſſed in both tables of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43506:46"/> morall Law, though with many weakneſſes and humane frailties (for in <hi>many things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all, Iam.</hi> 3.2.) is of ſufficient authority that way. Amongſt particular good works, which ſeem authorized by God in Scripture, to give evidence for the truth of any mans faith, works of Mercy if men be fruitful, and perſevering in them, ſuffering for the truth with patience and meekneſſe, together with forgiveneſs of injuries, and love ſhewed unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies upon occaſion, have the preheminence. Compare <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.15 <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6, 7.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.37.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>If juſtification conſiſteth (as hath been ſaid) in forgiveneſſe of ſins and is obtained by Faith, why is forgiveneſſe of ſins in Scripture ſometimes aſcribed unto Repentance, as it ſeemeth to be in theſe, and many other places?</hi> Eſa. 1.16, 17, 18. Pſal. 32.5. Ezek. 18.27.30.32. Mar. 1.4. Luk. 24.47. Act. 3.19. Acts 5.31. <hi>Is Faith and Repentance one and the ſame thing?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Although true faith, and true Repentance be not formally, and in definition, the ſame thing, yet they are as Twins receiving life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one and the ſame time in the ſoul; Yea they are ſo neer of kin, that they ſtill embrace and infold one the other, and are never parted: Yea they may ſeem to take place and to be effected and wrought by one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43506:47"/> and the ſame motion, or converſion, of the heart or ſoul; Even as a man by one and the ſame motion or turning about of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, turneth himſelf from the weſt, towards the eaſt, although turning from the Weſt, and turning to, or towards the Eaſt, be two things of a different conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In like manner, when a man work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off or turneth his heart from ſin, that is (in effect) when he repenteth, by the ſame act of altering, or changing his poſture, he turneth himſelf towards God, or towards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, he believeth. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf ſeemeth to ſtate the caſe much after this manner between Repentance and Faith, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 1.9. in this ſhort clauſe, <hi>And how yee turned unto God from Idols:</hi> which clearly implyeth, that their <hi>turning unto God,</hi> which importeth their believing; and their turning <hi>from Idols,</hi> which noteth their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, took place in them, and were effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by one and the ſame act of turning: So that if forgiveneſſe of ſins be aſcribed unto Repentance: it is aſcribed but unto that, which is <hi>materially</hi> the ſame with beleeving. Otherwiſe it may be ſaid to the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; that, by <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſins</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is oft meant not that generall or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal forgiveneſſe by which a perſon is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from the ſtate of condemnation into the ſtate of life and ſalvation; but only an exemption or diſcharge from the guilt, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43506:47"/> puniſhment due unto ſuch or ſuch particular ſins, according to the courſe of divine juſtice. As when <hi>Chriſt</hi> praied for thoſe who cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, <hi>Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do, Luk.</hi> 23, 34. So likewiſe <hi>Stephen</hi> for thoſe who ſtoned him, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge, Act.</hi> 7.60. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> for thoſe who forſook him, <hi>I pray God it may not be laid to their charge,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. I is plain, that the intent of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (reſpectively) onely was, that God would not judge, or puniſh them for the particular ſins committed againſt them. When men have ſinned greatly againſt God, whether belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or unbelievers, and are liable to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, he judgeth it a righteous thing, and well becomming him, either to pardon and paſſe by their ſin, and to remit the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment deſerved by them, upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; or to inflict this Puniſhment upon them, in caſe of their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. I ſuppoſe, it is onely in ſome ſuch ſenſe as this, that forgiveneſſe of ſins is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto Repentance. Or if that forgiveneſs of ſins which acompanieth ſalvation, be any where in 'Scripture aſcribed unto repentance, it is aſcribed unto it only as ſuch a means or cauſe of it, as that which Logicians call, <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa ſine qua non,</hi> that is, not as a cauſe operating towards the procuring of it, but as a condition without which it cannot be obtained.</p>

                     <p>Faith bears the relation of a Parent, or of a Mother in reſpect of Hope: and Hope the relation of a Daughter, in reſpect of Faith. For hope is a kind of natural reſult from Faith, as the light is from the body of the Sun, and hath it's dependence upon Faith, both for the reception and continuance of it's beeing: whereas Faith ſeems to have no dependence upon Hope for either. For a man muſt believe the truth and certainty of ſuch a promiſe, wherein any good thing one, or more is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto him, or (which is in effect the ſame) the faithfulneſſe of him that maketh this promiſe, together with his ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, before he can (reaſonably) or upon any good ground, hope for, or expect that good which is promiſed: eſpecially when he that ſhall make ſuch a promiſe was no waies obliged unto him, unto whom he maketh it; and moſt of all, if he ſhall moreover have been greatly provoked by him: which is the caſe concerning that Hope, of which we now ſpeak. But when once the perſon, to who many ſuch promiſe is made, ſhall really and firmly believe his promiſe, it is but natural and (as it were) matter of courſe for him to hope for all the good contained in ſuch a promiſe. And if he, that ſhall at firſt, or for a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch a promiſe as we ſpeak of, but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time wherein the promiſe is to be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43506:55"/> performed, ſhall upon any ſuggeſtion, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, caſt away, or let go ſuch his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, his hope muſt needs at the ſame time, and by means of the failing of his belief, fall to the ground. Only this would be here mentioned by way of caution: that although a promiſe of good things be made unto ſuch or ſuch a particular perſon in common with many others, and as well and with equall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of good unto him, in him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this promiſe, as unto any of the reſt, yet if this perſon ſhall either be ignorant that, or doubtful whether, this promiſe be made unto him, as well as unto others; he may believe the ſaid promiſe with the greateſt certainty and ſtedfaſtneſſe of Faith, and yet remain without all hope of the good things contained in this promiſe.</p>

                     <p>This priviledg is the great and high dignity of Adoption, or being made the Sons of God.

The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God. And if Children then Heires, Heires of God, and joynt-Heires with Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 8.15, 16, 17. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law to redeem thoſe that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons. And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, Crying Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a Servant, but a Son; and if a Son, then an Heir of God through Chriſt. Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, 7, Concerning the Sons of men and earthly inheritances, it is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to argue. <hi>If a Son, then an Heir:</hi> but, ſpeaking of the Sons of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance promiſed uuto them, the Argument is rational and valid. The reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lieth chiefly in rhe different natures, or conditions, of that inheritance, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43506:58"/> to conferre upon his Sons, and thoſe earthly inheritances which men have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon theirs. An earthly inheritance hath that imperfection in it, that it cannot be, at once, enjoyed whole and entire, by many, nor yet given unto, or ſetled upon, a plurality of Children, but that every one will have the leſſe, becauſe there are more to ſhare with him. Were it otherwiſe, and ſo that an earthly eſtate, or inheritance, could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto many upon ſuch termes, that the whole might be poſſeſſed and enjoyed by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them reſpectively, ordinarily, and in moſt caſes (at leaſt) the conſequence would be good, even amongſt the Children of men, If a Son, then an Heir: For there is ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Father, but would give his whole Eſtate unto all his Children (reſpectively) had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many, if it could be given by him, and enjoyed by them, upon ſuch termes. Now that heavenly Inheritance, which is reſerved by God for his Children, is ſo happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned, that the Collation of it upon never ſo many, and the Enjoyment of it likewiſe by never ſo many, and this together and at the ſame time, prejudiceth none (in the leaſt) of thoſe to whom it is given, or by whom it is enjoyed: but every one of them, reſpectively and apart, enjoieth it as fully, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, at as great a rate and height of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment joy and glory, as if he were the ſole poſſeſſour and enjoyer or proprietour of it.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43506:58"/> And for this reaſon (I ſuppoſe) it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtle, <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in Light. Coloſſ.</hi> 1.12. Namely becauſe as no man ſuſtain's the leaſt loſs, or inconvenience in his injoyment of the Light, by the vaſt multitude of perſons in the world that ſhare with him therein; ſo neither is the joy or glory of the inheritance of the Saints in any degree the leſs unto any one amongſt them, becauſe the number is ſo great that are partakers with him therein.</p>

                     <p>The words are theſe: <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord to the men of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Break up your fallow ground, and ſow not amongſt thornes. Circumciſe your ſelves unto the Lord, and take away the foreſkins of your hearts, leſt my fury come forth like fire, and burn,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43506:61"/> threatning them with his wrath and fury to their utter deſtruction, if they ſhall not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him therein, then (certainly) they have power to do the one or the other; otherwiſe he ſhould threaten to deſtroy his Creature for that which is no waies ſinful, nor a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any Law. For it is no waies ſinful for a Creature not to do things that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to do; or not to do that, which is poſſible only for God himſelf to do. Therefore (without controverſie) God doth afford unto unregenerate men (at leaſt if they be not many degrees worſe, and more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto him, then ſimply as ſuch) ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent abilities, and means, whereby to become new men, or make themſelves new hearts.

                     <p>Theſe, with all other Texts and paſſages of like import, are well and clearly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with that Doctrine, which aſſerteth a ſufficiency of power vouchſafed by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, whereby to ſanctifie, regenerate, and deny themſelves, to mortifie the deeds of the body, and generally to act and do every ſuch thing, which God hath declared to be of abſolute neceſſity for their Salvation. The fair conſiſtency between this Doctrine, and the Texts of Scripture mentioned (with their fellows) may be well underſtood by theſe, and ſuch like conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is one thing to be able, or to have a ſufficient power for the performance or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing: an other, to exerciſe, or make uſe of, this power, for the actual perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a ſufficiency of power to ſave himſelf from death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. but he made no uſe of this power for ſuch a purpoſe. Men may be inabled by God to make themſelves new hearts, and new ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not be made willing by him, no nor of, nor by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor by any other creature, to do it. Power to do that which is good, without a will to imploy it accordingly, is a juſt ground, and the only juſt ground, of condemnation and puniſhment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though it be ſuppoſed that men have a ſufficiency of power to make themſelves
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43506:68"/> new hearts, and further, that their hearts are made new; yet it doth not neceſſarily follow from hence, either that theſe new hearts are made by themſelves, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that power, or that they are not made by God. For God can do all things, which he hath inabled the creature to do: yea, and is many times pleaſed to do ſuch things himſelf, which the creature, inabled by him to do them, neglecteth notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doth them not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is not unuſual in other Writers, nor in ordinary diſcourſe, nor in the Scriptures themſelves elſewhere, to aſcribe an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement, or exploit, as well, nay rather, to him that ſhall command, incourage, order the method and means for, the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and accompliſhment of it, as to him that ſhall act it with his hand. In this reſpect every ſaving work that is found in men, may be (in ſufficient propriety of ſpeech) aſcribed unto God, becauſe he commandeth it, gives incouragement unto men to endeavour it, preſcribes methods and means for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, although it be ſuppoſed that men themſelves are the workers of it, and this out of thoſe abilities which they have received from him, by the uſe of ſuch and ſuch means vouchſafed likewiſe unto them, to perform it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is not improper, nor any uncouth Dialect, to aſcribe that, which is actually
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43506:69"/> done and performed by another, unto him that ſhall furniſh and accommodate him with all the ſtrength, power and means, by which be doth accompliſh it: yea, that which is performed and done in this caſe, is principally to be attributed unto him; and ſecondarily only, and in a meaner reſpect, unto the other.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, God is a God of judgment (<hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.27.) and therefore muſt needs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern and put a difference between thoſe, who in obedience to his command, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves new hearts, and new Spirits, and thoſe who turn their backs upon his charge in this kind, and hold on their courſe in the ſtubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impenitencie of their old corrupt and wicked hearts unto the end. Therefore Salvation being a reward judged meet by him
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43506:75"/> to be beſtowed upon the former, he cannot judge it meet likewiſe to be conferred upon the latter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God is a God of Truth alſo, and this as well in his threatenings, and execution of them, as in his promiſes and performance of them.

When the approaches of Death are apprehended, it is but a kind of natural Chriſtianity for them to purifie [or ſanctifie] themſelves (<hi>Job.</hi> 41.25.) and conſequently, to be as dead before hand, to all worldly or fleſhly defilements.</p>

                        <hi>Prayer</hi> unto God, indefinitely conſidered, and in the general, is no act, or exerciſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate unto <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, but is practiſed by many, amongſt whom <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Goſpel, were never ſo much as named; only at the motion and inſtance of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, no otherwiſe inſtructed, or inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then by hearkening unto the voice or dictates of thoſe Principles and ſeeds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge, which God by nature hath planted in them.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is to perſwade the heart in praying, or to believe, that what we aſk of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, we ſhall as certainly for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake [that is, by vertue of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intereſt, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> by meanes partly of his near relation, and partly of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worth and dignity, hath in God, and we through him] obtain, as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſhould in perſon make the ſame Prayer for us.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Why do you add theſe words,</hi> according to the will of God? <hi>Is it not enough to pray in the name of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and in Faith? Or, what do you mean by theſe words?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>When the Scripture ſaith thus, <hi>And this is the confidence that we have in him</hi> [or towards him, that is, God, by means of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>] <hi>that if we aſk any thing according to his will, he heareth us</hi> (1 Joh. 5.14.) that proviſional clauſe, <hi>If we aſk any thing according to his will,</hi> ſeemeth to include theſe two things; firſt that we aſk ſuch things only, which are meet and convenient for us, and ſo adjudged, and declared, in one kind or other, by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In that abſolute model, or preſcript, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning prayer (given by <hi>Chriſt</hi>), we are, for matters of this life, if not ſtrictly confined, yet graciouſly taught and directed, only to pray for, <hi>our daily bread</hi> [in oppoſition to a praying for riches, honours, pleaſures, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the great things of the world]. Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur</hi> long before, prayed unto God to <hi>feed him</hi> only <hi>with food convenient for him.</hi> Prov. 30.8. Therefore it being not <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> that we ſhould pray for the great things of the World [at leaſt, for our ſelves] if we make any ſuch Prayer as this unto him, he is at liberty whether he will hear us, or no, notwithſtanding any promiſe of audience made by him. Secondly, The
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43506:89"/> ſaid words of caution, or proviſo, <hi>according to his will,</hi> ſeem to import this alſo; that we muſt be orderly and regular in our ends which we propound unto our ſelves in asking any the good things of this life of God; as that we ask them not to gratify our luſts with them but to maintain our ſelves in an honeſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and cheerful poſture, and condition, for the ſervice of God, and of men (for his ſake.).</p>

                        <hi>Are there more kinds of Prayer (I mean, of Prayer that is regular, and accepted with God) then one; or but one only?</hi>

                        <hi>How do theſe</hi> 4 <hi>kinds of prayer</hi> (<hi>as you lately ſaid they may be called,</hi> Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, giving of Thanks) <hi>differ the one from the other?</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Supplications,</hi> are requeſts made unto God for our own deliverance or preſervation from evill; whether in reſpect of our ſins by which we have deſerved evill; or of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of our preſent condition by reaſon whereof we are (howſoever) expoſed unto evill. <hi>Prayers</hi> (in the ſtrict ſenſe of the word) are requeſts made unto God for the obtaining of the good things, whether ſpiritual, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, of which we ſtand in need. Theſe two would (ordinarily at leaſt) be joined together in our petitionary applications unto God. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Interceſſions</hi> are Requeſts made unto God for others, whether it be for their deliverance from evill, or for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of ſome poſitive good things, one or more for them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 5. The verb, from which the word is derived, ſometimes ſignifieth to pray, not for, but againſt others. <hi>Act.</hi> 25.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.2. Laſtly, <hi>giving of Thanks,</hi> is a chearful, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, and ingaging Acknowledgment, made and tendered unto God, for any good that hath been done by him, whether immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43506:90"/> by himſelf, or mediately by inſtruments: either unto our ſelv s or unto others. This kind of Prayer ought ſtill to be joyned with the former, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether is it lawful to pray to Angells, or to Saints, or unto any other, whether perſon, or thing, but God only?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Scripture alloweth no Prayer to be made, either to Angel, or to Saint, but unto God only. It is here plainly affirmed, that God <hi>heareth Prayer,</hi> (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 65.2.) And there are inſtances and proofs without number, ſcattered up and down the Scriptures evincing this to be true: but there is not the leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture, or whiſper, that either Angel or Saint, whileſt remaining in Heaven, hear any <hi>Prayer</hi> made unto them on the earth. If they did, why ſhould not all fleſh come unto them, as the Scripture affirmeth it ſhal or will come unto God upon the account of ſo-ſtrongly-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting a propertie. <hi>O thou that heareſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come: Pſa.</hi> 65.12. And elſewhere, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>That every one that is Godly ſhall make his Prayer unto him. Pſa.</hi> 12.6. So that there are none but <hi>ungodly</hi> ones left to pray unto Saints or Angels. Nor did <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when, upon requeſt, he taught his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and in them, all men, to pray, ſend them either to Saint, or to Angel, but unto God only: <hi>After this manner therefore pray ye.

                     </p>
                     <p>Inaſmuch as Prayer is only a repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or tender of the motions and deſires of the heart and ſoul unto God, if we can raiſe and be accordingly careful to raiſe, ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions and deſires, as are expreſſed in the words which we read, ſuppoſing theſe to be regular, and ſuch as are meet to be found in us, and that all along as we read, we be alike mindful to hold forth or tender theſe motions and deſires unto God. I ſee no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to condemn praying by a Book, as ſimply, or in all ſorts of men unlawful;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43506:97"/> when the Maſter of a Family upon whom it lieth as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-duty to pray with thoſe of his houſe from time to time, is not guifted with competent utterance. Judge it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for him when he prayeth with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, rather to make uſe of a book, then to undertake the duty without it. But as we are juſtly offended with thoſe, who being health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſound in their limbs, leggs, and feet, are well able to go and walk without crutches; and yet as if they were lame, will ordinarily uſe them, as the worſt and lazieſt ſort of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are wont to doe; So when men that are enabled by God of themſelves, and without the help of a book, to utter and expreſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently (at leaſt) the inward conceptions, motions, and deſires of their Souls, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſhall diſſemble and (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) deny the ability, and guift which God hath given them in that behalf, by making uſe of a book, or writing alwaies when they pray, They are in <hi>Peters</hi> condemnation when <hi>Paul</hi> reproved him for diſſembling, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When a perſon deſireth to pray private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the preſence and hearing of God only, although his gift of utterance be never ſo mean, yet I ſuppoſe it more convenient for him to make uſe of it, then of a book, at ſuch a time; partly becauſe God needeth not the ſignificancy of words (nor, indeed any words at all) to come to the knowledge of our deſires; partly becauſe guifts by an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43506:97"/> and conſcientious uſe of them, and the bleſſing of God thereon, are oft times impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the imperfection of them (to a good degree) healed; partly alſo, becauſe the heart is at ſo much the more liberty to conceive deſires, or petitions, of the beſt accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a mans preſent condition, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whatſoever they be.</p>

Lawful, whether is the conſtant uſe of it amongſft people, by him who is their mouth in Prayer, more expedient or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing more edification, or comfort unto them, then ſuch prayers, which are from time to time conceived, and uttered, by the guift of prayer, at the ſame time?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Prayer of a freſh and preſent concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it is uttered, being conceived by the Spirit, or by a guift of Prayer, hath ſome things in it, which render it more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to edifie and comfort thoſe, that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, then one and the ſame Prayer ſtill repeated.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A prayer that is new, is more like to awaken and engage attention in thoſe that are to joyn in it. Cuſtomary things are but as matters of courſe, which are commonly paſſed over with little, or no obſervation. Whereas things that are new, are of kin to things that are ſtrange, after which even they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43506:98"/> that are but drowſily diſpoſed, wil force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hearken. God himſelf makes account that if men ſhould be but able to ſay, even of his great works, when he bringeth them forth, <hi>Behold, we knew them before,</hi> that they would deſpiſe, or (at leaſt) leſſe regard them. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48.7.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A prayer newly conceived by the help of the Spirit of God, comes warm from the heart, and ſo is more like to convey warmth to the hearts of thoſe that hear it, then a Prayer that is brought out of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where it hath lain for a long time dead; Beſides, the womb of the memory, and much more of a book is but a cold place, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that of the heart or ſoul.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, That a prayer which is brought out of the treaſury of the memory may, when it is uttered come from the heart alſo, and this with as much ſpiritual warmth, or heat, as if it had been newly conceived here; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
                     <p>The heart cannot in reaſon, be ſo much rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or ingaged with borrowing of, or from the memory, or with delivering out, what is borrowed from hence, as with travailing in birth with new conceptions, and in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth theſe with apt expreſſions, which muſt ſuddainly be found and taken up.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A prayer conceived by a ſpiritual gift (and ſuch is the gift of Prayer) is more proper for a Church or Church-Aſſembly, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43506:98"/> like to do better ſervice here, then a prayer compoſed or framed by a natural gift, one or more, as good parts or abilities of learning, rhetorique, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I take this for granted, that no perſon, that finds, or knows himſelf to be endued by God with a gift of prayer (and he that is thus endued by him cannot likely be long ignorant of it) will decline the uſe, or exerciſe of this guift, and chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imply his natural gift inſtead of it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Praying from time to time, with variety of matter, with new and different petitions, and expreſſions, doth ſet forth and commend, upon terms of farre greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the unſearchable riches of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdome, knowledge and bounty of the Spirit of God, then the conſtant uſe of one, and the ſame Prayer: and conſequently, muſt needs be more like to awaken men to diſcern and acknowledge the gracious preſence of God with them, or among them, in their holy aſſemblies, and likewiſe to glorifie him for vouchſafing ſo much of himſelf, or of his goodneſſe unto men; as it is ſaid; They <hi>marvelled, and glorified God, which had given ſuch power unto men, Mat.</hi> 9,8. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expoſtulates thus with the Church of <hi>Corinth, Know ye not your own ſelves</hi> [though I ſhould not affirm it or remind you of it] <hi>how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you</hi> [or rather among you in your Church-community; meaning, by a notable preſence of his power, and of his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43506:99"/> grace and love towards you] <hi>except ye be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates</hi> [or rather, very injudicious and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning; meaning that thoſe Apoſtolical gifts and abilities which God had given him for their ſakes, and of which they had had large Teſtimony and proof amongſt them, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiy demonſtrate the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the middeſt of them] 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, (and laſtly) when men pray by a gift of Prayer, the Holy Ghoſt is at full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both to act their Hearts and Spirits in prayer, as he pleaſeth, and to prompt them with ſuch Holy motions, and ſtreins of peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he judgeth moſt congruous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the reſpective occaſions, of thoſe that are preſent; and withall, to act their tongues and lipps in praying, and to give them utterance, as he pleaſeth: Whereas he that alwaies confineth himſelf to a ſet form of words in praying, confineth alſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God either to give him alwaies one and the ſame matter of Prayer, or a like ſet form of motions, and deſires to preſent in prayer unto God; or otherwiſe to permit him to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words in prayer, which in their ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have no agreement with the inward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon his heart. Beſides, he that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon ſuch termes, doth not ſo much ſpeak as the Spirit gives him utterance, but rather as he gives utterance unto the Spirit, or at the beſt, unto himſelf.</p>

                     <p>When the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> [or effectual fervent, as our laſt tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rendreth the word] <hi>Prayer of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous availeth M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH,</hi> (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.) he clearly ſuppoſeth, that the Prayer of ſuch a perſon (a righteous man) though it were not <hi>fervent</hi> in the ſame degree, yet might to a lower, or leſſe degree prevail with God alſo.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43506:101"/> And if the Righteouſneſſe of him that prayeth contributeth towards the acceptation, and prevailingneſſe of the prayer with God (which is plainly enough likewiſe imported in the ſaid Saying) it is not to be doubted, but that when two righteous men, yet the one in Righteouſneſſe excelling or exceeding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which very poſſibly may be, yea and commonly is the caſe between two righteous perſons) ſhall pray together, yea and this with equal fervency (and faith too); the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the one, namely his that excelleth in Righteouſneſſe, ſhall have the preheminence in acceptation with God. So when another Apoſtle writeth thus to the <hi>Hebrews. Pray for us: for we truſt we have a good conſcience, in all things willing to live honeſtly. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you the rather</hi> [or, ſomewhat the more earneſtly, as the former tranſlation reads it] <hi>to do this, that I may be reſtored to you the ſooner Heb.</hi> 13.18, 19. He ſeemeth to imply, that they might procure from God his liberty and return unto them the ſooner, if they did quit themſelves accordingly in their prayers for him; as it is obſerved by the Holy Ghoſt, that, inſtanr and earneſt prayer was made by the Church for <hi>Peter</hi> when he was ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and miraculouſly delivered out of Priſon, and reſtored unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How or by what means, may a perſon come to intereſſe himſelf in the great priviledge, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43506:101"/> of</hi> Praying ferventlie?</p>

                     <p>Theſe conſiderations laid, and kept cloſe, and warm to the heart and conſcience, will ſtand him in much ſtead, and do him good ſervice, that way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That when he prayeth, he beateth not the aire, but ſpeaketh in the ears of the living God, whoſe propertie, yea and glory it is, to hear Prayers (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2.) Yea and can no more lay aſide this property, then <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That when he offereth up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications with ſtrong cries and tears, (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have done <hi>in the aaies of his fleſh, Heb.</hi> 5.) he forcibly ſtriketh or ſmiteth upon the tender bowels and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions of God, and cauſeth theſe to move and work within him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That when he ſhall, once, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, have reaped the fruit of his Prayers, and been ſupplyed, according to the deſire of his Soul, out of the Treaſures of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bounty, and power of God, his heart will be filled to the brim with gladneſſe and joy hereupon; according to that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his diſciples; — <hi>Aſk and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that your Joy may be full.

                     <p>Fourthly, That if he ſhall at any time pray looſely, coldly, drowſily, or as if he cared not much whether he prayed or no, he will expoſe himſelf to the eminent danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43506:102"/> his Prayer: which may very poſſibly turn to a matter of ſad conſequence unto him, and prove either an occaſion of his declining in Faith or love towards God; or of a greater indifferency and remiſneſs to pray afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That it concerns him, both as much as his comfort and peace in this world, and eſpecially as much as the Salvation of his ſoul in the World to come, do amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that his prayer findeth acceptance with God: which it is not like to do, if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory, and ſleight, and hath not the ſtrength of the heart and ſoul in it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, (and laſtly). That a mans heart, or ſpirit can never upon no occaſion or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence whatſoever, be called up, and made to give out its luſt and ſtrength, to a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, benefit, or bleſſing unto him, then when he is to ingage in the great duty and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exerciſe of Prayer. If the heart be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly preſſed, urged, and importuned with the weight and conſequence of theſe, and the like conſiderations, when a man is upon drawing neer unto God in Prayer, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (lightly) but attend him in the action with the beſt and uttermoſt improvement and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of it ſelf, whereof it is well capable.</p>

                        <hi>What Faith, or what kind of Faith is it, which is required of a Perſon in praying, to render his Prayer accepted with God? Is it only a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith; Or is it a Faith or belief, that God

                     <p>
                        <hi>But if ſuch a Faith as this availeth (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the terms or conditions now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to the acceptation of our Prayer with God, may not he that prayeth be filled with aſſurance, and this ordinarily, that he ſhall receive from God the very ſelf-ſame thing,</hi> in ſpecie, <hi>or in the letter (as we uſe to ſay) which he prayeth for, whatever it be, as whether it concerns his temporal comfort in this world, or his eternall well-being in that which is to come? For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no hard matter for him that hath any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of God, to believe ſtedfaſtly, both that he heareth, and regardeth the Prayers of all good men, and likewiſe that he wanteth neither goodneſſe of will, towards them, nor
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43506:103"/> power, to grant them their deſire. Or may both theſe be in God, and yet ſuch men be denied the good thing they aſk in Prayer of him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moſt certain it is, that God neither wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth goodneſſe of will, or largeneſſe of heart, towards thoſe that love him, nor yet any ſufficiency of power to grant them whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they deſire of him. Nevertheleſſe it may ſtand with his good will, not alwaies to grant unto them in particular what they deſire; no though they deſire nothing but according to his will (in the ſenſe formerly declared.<note n="(a)" place="margin">In the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the fourth Queſtion in this Chapter.</note> And yet in this caſe, the Prayer made upon ſuch termes unto him, may be of good acceptance with him, though it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him for the thing particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. This is manifeſt from that denial which the prayer of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf received from God, although it is not to be doubted, but that it was both a Prayer according to the will of God, and preferred with great zeal and fervency of Spirir, yea and thrice (at leaſt) re-inforced, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. A like inſtance for the purpoſe in hand, we have, if the place be well conſidered, Luk. 10.5, 6, with <hi>Mat.</hi> 10, 12, 13. But from the inſtance (now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) of the denial returned by God unto <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prayer, it is further evident, that no perſon can be groundedly confident, that all his Prayers, though framed and preſented,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43506:103"/> according to the will of God, ſhall proſper to the obtaining of every particular deſired in them: No, nor yet that any one of his Prayers for temporal good things, though ſo fram'd and preſented, ſhall thus proſper or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 22.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But is not this a great diſcouragement unto prayer, at leaſt for temporal things, that he that prayeth, can have no full aſſurance of obtaining what he deſireth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould have had no aſſurance of finding his Fathers aſſes, when he went and travalled up and down to ſeek them, yet if he had been aſſured, that in caſe he ſhould not find the aſſes, yet in ſeeking theſe, he ſhould find a Kingdome, his want of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſurance, conſidering the latter, would have been no diſcouragement unto him from taking pains to ſeek them. In like manner the aſſurance which the ſervants of God have or may have, that when they pray for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good things, if they receive not in kind what they ask, they ſhall receive it in full value, (if not with an overplus) leaves no place, nor pretence for their diſcouragment from praying for temporal things. And though they can have no abſolute aſſurance that, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for outward good things, they ſhall have a return made by God according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Prayer; Yet have they grounds
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43506:104"/> of hope for their prevailing even in this kind, more rich and promiſing, then the hopes of men generally are built upon, when their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of compaſſing great things in the world are raiſed to the higheſt. God doth not ordinarily turn his back upon the very letter of the prayers of his Saints, which are made unto him (all the Lawes of ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers duely obſerved) for temporall good things.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>What may be the reaſon, why God at any time denieth that temporall good thing, which is ſought at his hand by Prayer, when both the perſon that prayeth pleaſeth him, and the prayer likewiſe pleaſeth him, his whole will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure concerning this duty being carefully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly obſerved in the managing of it, at leaſt as farre as the underſtanding of a Man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcern, and judge?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>God may have ſome purpoſe, or deſign, of great conſequence, at preſent unrevealed, and unknown to him that prayeth (ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bound to take notice of it) which he cannot effect or bring to paſſe according to his mind, and as his Wiſdome hath preſcribed the method, and manner of the effecting it, but under ſuch circumſtances, or upon ſuch termes which are inconſiſtent with his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him who prayeth (in the caſe in hand) according to the letter of his Prayer. God
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43506:104"/> ſometimes ſteppeth aſide out of the road of his ordinary and ſtanding providence, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the world, or ſome members of it, with ſomewhat of great concernment unto them, wherein he could not, at leaſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his mind, gratifie them, keeping his wonted courſe in his providential adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It was (and is) the Law, or Rule, of his ordinary providence, <hi>to help and deliver righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men out of the hand of the wicked, and to ſave them, becauſe they truſt in him,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> expreſly affirmeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37, 39, 40.

Yet being to put in execution his great and happie Deſign of Saving a loſt world, and not knowing how to pleaſe himſelf in doing it, but by making a breach upon the ſaid Law, he diſpenced with it accordingly, and delivered up the moſt righteous Perſon that ever was, into the hands of wicked men. In like manner though the granting of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men the very letter of their Prayer, and this in matters of this life, as well as in things appertaining to Salvation, be the way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his providence moveth and acteth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily (alwaies ſuppoſing their Prayer in this kind to be regular) yet he may ſometimes have ſuch a deſign, either for the ſignal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him that prayeth, or for ſome great benefit of the world about him, in one
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43506:105"/> kind or other, which his wiſdome dictates unto him, cannot be ſo commodiouſly effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for his glory, unleſſe the letter of his Prayer be denyed unto him, and ſomewhat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in exchange for it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But doth not the Scripture require a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faith in him that prayeth, that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, even in kind, the good things which he ſeeks of God in Prayer (whether it be of the good things of this Life, or of that which is to come) not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing any return of a mans Prayer from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men without ſuch a Faith?

                     <p>Firſt, Certain it is, that particular good things have been granted by God unto the prayers of good men, where there was no great confidence, much leſſe any full or groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aſſurance of Faith, that they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43506:105"/> them. Thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that prayed for <hi>Peters</hi> deliverance out of Priſon (<hi>Act.</hi> 12.) had (it ſeems) no fulneſſe of aſſurance that they ſhould prevail. For when the Maid brought them tidings that <hi>Peter</hi> was at the door, they told her, <hi>ſhe was mad</hi> to ſay ſuch a thing: and when they could not abate her confidence, yet could they not believe that it was <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; the belief of this, though they had been, and ſtill were in Prayer for his deliverance, was notwithſtanding farther from them, then the belief of a moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tradition concerning Angels, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they ſhould not only appear in the ſhapes and likeneſſes of ſuch men to whom they are ſuppoſed to be aſſigned by God for gardians, but that they ſhould alſo counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their tone and voice in ſpeaking: Then ſaid they (ſaith the Text), <hi>It is his Ange. Verſe</hi> 15. And vvhen they ſaw that it was he indeed, it is ſaid, <hi>They were aſtoniſhed ver.</hi> 16. By theſe paſſages it fully appears, that they had no fulneſſe of aſſurance of obtaining <hi>Peters</hi> inlargement, at leaſt not ſo ſoon as they did obtain it, when they prayed for it. In like manner the prayer of the Leper in the Goſpel, being conceived in theſe words (as all the three former Evangeliſts record it) <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> plainly importeth, that neither had he any height of confidence that he ſhould obtain his cleanſing by it; his Prayer, as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43506:106"/> his doubtfulneſſe of the will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as his confidence of his power, to heal him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. Another like inſtance we have in him that prayed thus for his Child, being poſſeſſed with an unclean Spirit? <hi>If thou canſt do any thing, help us, and have compaſſion on us.</hi> And being put upon it, and provoked by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to believe, yet did he advance no further then only to ſuch a Faith, which was incumbred with doubtings and <hi>unbelief.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding his Prayer for his Child proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered to the obtaining of that great cure, or deliverance which was ſought for by it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.22, 23, 24. Therefore</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by that <hi>wavering,</hi> or toſſing to and fro in Prayer, which hath no promiſe, but a threatning rather of being ſent empty away, ſeemeth to be meant, not every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of doubting, whether he that prayeth, ſhall receive according to the letter of his Prayer or no, but an inſtability of mind, a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and falling, a coming and going, an eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing, in his beleif concerning God's hearing and accepting him in his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or concerning his Power of doing for him according to his Petition. Such a fluctuation and unſettledneſſe as this, in a mans opinion, judgment, or faith, about the great Attributes of God, his truth and faithfulneſſe, his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, omnipotency <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is very uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unſavoury in him, that profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Servant and Worſhipper of him.</p>

Of this kind of Faith the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying in the context, that it may be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons void of the heavenly affection of Love, which is the right hand of that Faith, that is found in all the Saints, and inſeparable from it?</p>

                     <p>The end of the Saints application unto God by Prayer, being to prevail with him to do, and consequently to be willing to do ſuch things, which they had no ſufficient ground to expect that he would do for them, or (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently) that he would have been willing to do for them (for he doth nothing but by the motion of his will) unleſſe they had ſought them by Prayer at his hand; any ſuch clauſe inſerted in their Prayer as this. <hi>If it be thy Will,</hi> ſeemeth to imply one of theſe two
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43506:107"/> things (both of them inconvenient) either, Firſt, That unleſſe God were willing, before their Prayer, and conſequently without their Prayer, or whether they prayed unto him, or no, to give them that, for which they pray, they were content to go without it, and willing that God ſhould turn himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their Prayer; Or, Secondly, That they were very diffident, or much in doubt, whether he would be prevailed with by their Prayer to be willing to do for them, what they deſire therein. Whereas that frame of heart, which becometh men in Prayer, requires ſome degree (at leaſt) of an humble confidence that God, upon and by means of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (made unto him according to his will) will become willing to grant them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yea though it be in temporal things (in which he ſeems to take the greateſt liberty to change the Prayers of his Saints) unleſſe there be ſuch a barre in the way (as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned) namely, Gods being in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with ſome great deſign of Good, which cannot be commodiouſly effected, in caſe he ſhould grant unto ſuch, or ſuch, of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the letter of their Prayer. Now the beſt way to expreſſe the ſubmiſſion of our wills, to the will of God, in ſuch caſes, is in that form uſed by our Saviour upon the ſame account: <hi>If it be poſſible. O my Father, if it be poſſible</hi> [meaning, if thou haſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as pleaſing unto thee, whereby to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43506:108"/> gloryfie thy ſelf in the Salvation of the world as by my Death] <hi>let this Cup paſſe from me. Nevertheleſſe</hi> [as if he ſhould ſay, though my deſire of ſelf-preſervation, eſpecially from ſo horrid a death, as that which I apprehend I am ſhortly ro ſuffer, be exceeding ſtrong, and as great, as great may be] <hi>Nevertheleſſe not as I will, but as thou wilt</hi> [that is, as another Evangeliſt hath it, not my will but thine be done] <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.42. When our minds, or wills, are ſtrongly ſet upon any thing, which is of more then ordinary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence unto us then is it moſt ſeaſonable, and needfull, when we pray for it, to pray with this condition, or <hi>proviſo, If it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> meaning hereby (as hath been hinted) if the granting unto us what we deſire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, be well-conſiſting with all thy counſels and purpoſes otherwiſe (it being unpoſſible and (indeed) unreaſonable, that any of Gods purpoſes, or decrees, being all ſo wiſe, and holy, and good, ſhould give place to the gratification of any Creature whatſoever.) And in ſuch a caſe, to have the ſubmiſſion of our wills unto the will of God in that kind prepared, and (as it were) ready drawn up to be exhibited and tendred unto him.</p>

                     <p>What men take up, and impoſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in or about the worſhip of God upon the account of their own wiſdoms, or wills, is no worſhip of acceptation with him, who frequently gives this account, and this only of his rejection of ſuch, and ſuch ſervices of men, that <hi>he commanded them not,</hi> Jer. 7.31. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.19, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.5. &amp; 32.35. See alſo <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.12, 13. &amp; 66.4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.15. (with others) And there is this great evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attending ſervices and devotions of mens own contrivement, that they ſecretly intiſe and draw away the hearts and ſouls of men from the worſhip enjoyned by God, unto themſelves, and incroach upon the reſpects and eſteem due unto his Precepts. The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men though they be only collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not contradictious, unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, yet are they apt upon ſuch an account to make them of little or no effect. Notwithſtanding where God hath left any circumſtance concerning his worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, ſo that what he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this kind, cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the doing of ſomewhat, which he hath not commanded (which is the caſe in moſt, if not all his precepts concerning worſhip) here a man may (nay of neceſſity he muſt, in one kind or other) determine himſelf. But if in this Caſe he ſhall determine himſelf once
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43506:114"/> for all, and ingage himſelf to act uniformly, or after the ſame manner, perpetually: he had need be very circumſpect and cautious, leaſt by ſuch an ingagement, he ſpreads a ſnare in his own way; and this, as in other reſpects ſo mainly in this, that what he doth upon his own election, he putteth not to the account of worſhip, nor equalize it in eſteem with what he doth according to the expreſſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. As for example (in the buſineſſe in hand) God injoineth men to pray continually or without ceaſing. But he hath not injoined them to pray ſo many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately, as three, four, five, or ſix times in every 24 or every 48 howrs, or the like. Yet he that ſhal <hi>Chriſtianly,</hi> and conſcientiouſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the ſaid Commandement of God, muſt determine himſelf to one or other of theſe numbers, or ſome other, within the ſaid ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either occaſionally, and with liberty to change both the number and ſeaſon alſo of his times, when, and as he pleaſeth, or elſe unchangeably, as by impoſing ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious tie upon himſelf to pray, ſo oft, (as ſuppoſe 3, 4, 5, or 6 times) every 24 houres, and at ſuch and ſuch ſeaſons, or houres, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the day or night, after ſuch a manner as canonical houres (ſo called) are obſerved amongſt the Papiſts. Now then this is that which I ſay; that he that ſhall (in the caſe in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) determine himſelf in the latter vvay mentioned, had need look narrowly and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43506:114"/> attentively, both before him, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, leſt he intangle himſelf to his great prejudice otherwiſe; but eſpecially leſt that which is of his own, and from himſelf, in his courſe of praying, be not of higher eſteem with him, then that which is of God, and that the tale or number of his prayers, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his ſelect hours, be not more min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then his prayers themſelves, or then the making and preſenting of them with that Faith fervency, and devotion of ſoul, which are required by God.</p>

                     <p>It is not (I ſuppoſe) doubted by any man, but that frequency of Ejaculations, and the darting up the heart and ſoul into Heaven in ſpiritual motions and deſires at any time, or
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43506:115"/> in any place, without any pronunciation of words, is a practiſe or exerciſe well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Saints, and of good acceptance with God. Yea, I rather queſtion whether there be any true Saint, who doth not more, or leſſe, uſe it. Nevertheleſſe I do not conceive that when either <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any of his Apoſtles, exhort and charge men to <hi>Pray continually,</hi> and <hi>to watch hereunto,</hi> they are to be underſtood of ſuch a kind of Praying; but of that rather, wherein a man, withdrawing into ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place, ſetteth himſelf in the preſence of God; and ſo humbly, and with reverence due to ſo great a Majeſty, diſcourſeth in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with him, the important affairs of his Soul; ſtriving and wreſtling with him withall ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe and importunity, to obtain from him all ſuch ſupplies and vouchſafements of Grace, and Mercy, which he judgeth need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, either for his own comfort and peace, or for theirs, whoſe conditions he judgeth it his duty to recommend together with his own unto God. For ſuch a kind of praying as this, is that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> enjoyneth: <hi>But when thou prayeſt enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret — But when ye pray, uſe not vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, as the Heathen do: for they think they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6, 7. Therefore that kind of Prayer, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> requireth of men in the ordinary courſe of their praying, is to be managed by ſpeech
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43506:115"/> or by an oral prolation of words, and to be performed with as much privacie, or retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mans ſelf, as well may be. For words are very requiſite and uſeful, even in private Prayer, as well for the quickning and keeping up a mans intention, and for the preventing of drowſineſſe and diſtractions in praying, as for the exerciſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his gift of utterance.</p>

                     <p>In the Scriptures we find that both the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and his Saints likewiſe, did very frequently uſe the geſture of kneeling, when they prayed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.60. <hi>Act.</hi>

And this (doubtleſſe) is a very proper and comely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the body, when we pray unto God. Yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf did not uſe it conſtantly, for the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> recordeth, that <hi>he fell down on the ground and prayed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.35. as <hi>Joſhua</hi> likewiſe, and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him, had done long before, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.6. And though there be no other bodily geſture, but only the lifting up of his eies to Heaven mentioned by the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> to have been uſed by him in the uttering of that moſt heavenly prayer, <hi>John.</hi> 17. Yet it is the probable conjecture of a good expoſitour, that he neither kneeled, nor lay proſtrate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, when he pronounced it, but that as he was walking with his diſciples, he made a ſtand, and ſo without any other change of the poſition of his body offered up this prayer unto God. When hanging upon the croſſe, he prayed for thoſe that crucified him <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. he was in a differing poſture from all the reſt. And notwithſtanding the texts pointed to for the geſture of kneeling in prayer, yet it is the more general ſenſe (as farre as I have obſerved) of learned men, that ſtanding was the more ordinary poſture of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they prayed, unleſſe it were in times of great Mourning, when they prayed either kneeling, or proſtrate on the ground. Yea the Scripture it ſelf ſpeaketh as well, and with as much approbation, of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43506:117"/> ſtanding as of kneeling in Prayer: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, as well the one, as the other, to be lawfull <hi>But when ye ſhall ſtand, and pray, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, if ye have any thing againſt any man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.25. The <hi>Publican</hi> alſo juſtified by our Saviour before the <hi>Phariſie,</hi> prayed <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> when he ſmote his breaſt, and ſaid. <hi>God be merciful unto me a Sinner, Luk</hi> 18.13. The Children of <hi>Iſrael ſtood and confeſſed their Sins,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Levites ſtood</hi> and prayed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and called upon the people to ſtand up and praiſe the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Nehem.</hi> 9.2.4, 5. See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. &amp; 18, 19. <hi>Job.</hi> 30.20. Where we read, <hi>But</hi> Abraham <hi>ſtood yet before the Lord</hi> (Gen. 18.22.) the <hi>Chaldee</hi> readeth, <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, <hi>&amp;c. Hezekiah</hi> prayed ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Bed, and with his face to the wall <hi>Eſai.</hi> 38.2. In the primitive times, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> uſed both poſtures in their prayings, as well ſtanding as kneeling: only their grounds for appropriating the one to one time of the year, and the other, to another, and ſo the one <hi>kneeling,</hi> to their penitentiaries (for a certain ſeaſon) and allowing the other, <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to the reſt, ſeem to have had, more of the ſand, then of the rock in them. Though I do not any where read of the poſture of <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> uſed in Prayer, yet by the rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion from <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> praying (and this with acceptation in the ſight of God) lying upon his bed, being through ſickneſſe, not well capable (at preſent) of any other poſture, I
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43506:118"/> ſuppoſe it may be argued and ſafely concluded that men and women, if either through ſome weakneſſe, or want of preſent accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion otherwiſe, they cannot without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, offer their ſacrifice of Prayer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneeling, or ſtanding, they may do it <hi>ſitting</hi> without ſuſtaining any damage in their acceptance with God, only if they bow the knee of the heart and ſoul unto him.</p>

                     <p>I do not remember that any one perſon: beſides <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is recorded in Scripture to have lift up his eies to Heaven, when he called upon God; although it is not improbable but that many others of the Saints did likewiſe uſe the ſame geſture when they prayed. Nor is it (I preſume) at all queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but that it may very lawfully, if not commendably, at leaſt by ſome perſons, be uſed now. For the lifting up of the eyes to Heaven when a man is about to pray, is a natural and proper action, or means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the remembrance of the glorious and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43506:118"/> incomprehenſible Majeſty of God in his Soul and to create awful and reverential impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in him, of the tranſcendent holineſſe of him, with whom he hath then to do; <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> being <hi>the habitation of his holineſſe, and of his Glory, Eſa.</hi> 63.15. Beſides ſome conceive it to be a geſture, or behaviour, proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe or ſignifie a mans Faith, and holy boldneſſe, and confidence in God, when he prayeth. This apprehenſion ſeemeth very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (if not ſomewhat more) from thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherein he deſcribeth the demeanour of the poor <hi>Publican,</hi> as of a perſon weak in Faith, and much dejected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of his own unworthineſſe, when he was about to pray, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he would not ſo much as lift up his eies unto Heaven,</hi> Luk. 18.13. So <hi>Ezra</hi> being in great aſtoniſhment and trembling for the high miſdemeanour of his people, begun his Prayer thus; <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, &amp;c.</hi> Ezra. 9.6. Yet theſe paſſages ſhew and prove, that the lifting up the eies to Heaven, when we pray, is not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but that we may be accepted in our praier without it. There is ſomewhat the like conſideration of the ſpreading, or lifting up of the hands towards Heaven, in <hi>Prayer.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this ſeems to have been more frequently uſed in this holy action, then the other of lifting up the eies. Notwithſtanding though it be recorded as the deportment of ſeveral
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43506:119"/> of the Saints in ſome of their prayers, as of <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon, Ezra, &amp;c.</hi> Yet it is not neceſſary to believe, that either all the ſervants of God, when they prayed, uſed it, or that theſe perſons themſelves uſed it at all times, when they prayed: nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is ſo eſſential to the regularity of Prayer, but that this ſervice may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with good acceptance in the ſight of God, without it. It ſeems to be ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (as the other likewiſe was, as was lately hinted) of the Faith of thoſe that prayed; For the lifting up their hands towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was in token of their confidence that God would give them what they asked, and that they prepared themſelves accordingly to receive it by lifting up rheir hands towards him of whom they ask it.</p>

But the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tb accommodate all that ſhould deſire to pray unto God with acceptation, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in their way, hath contracted into a few words, the ſum and ſubſtance of what is diſperſed up and down the Scriptures upon thoſe accounts, in that brief modell which we call, the <hi>LORDS PRAYER.</hi>

                        <hi>Whether was it his intent that this Prayer, ſhould be, either conſtantly or frequently, uſed in the nature of a Prayer, without any variation of the words, or that it ſhould be as a brief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, pattern, or platform, by which they who pray might be ſteered and guided in their way, unto ſuch particulars, which are neceſſary for them to know?</hi>

                     <p>That it was intended by him as a directory or platform, by which men might be taught how to pray, is not (I ſuppoſe) queſtioned by any. And in this notion of it, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) in preſcribing it, directly anſwered the intent of his Diſciples in their requeſt (made unto him by one of their company) the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour whereof was, that he <hi>would teach them to pray, Luk.</hi> 11.1 Their meaning (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) was not, to deſire him to bind them ſtrictly to a certain form of words in their praying, but to <hi>teach them to pray,</hi> that is, how to pray [<hi>viz.</hi> with acceptation in the ſight of God]. And himſelf, being now ready to dictate this prayer unto them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his mind concerning it to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>After THIS MANNER there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pray yee: Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that their prayers which they ſhould from time to time preſent unto God, ſhould both for matter and manner, be ordered and framed, as that brief modell, or compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of prayer, which he would now propoſe to them, ſhould direct them. And that the Apoſtles themſelves underſtood, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from him in this notion, and not as a ſet prayer, to be either conſtantly, or frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, appears by their practice upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture record. For whereas we here often read of their praying, and ſeveral of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are recorded, yet do we no where find
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43506:121"/> that ever they made uſe of the ſaid prayer in the nature, or inſtead of a Prayer; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the nature of a directory, or rule, how to pray, all their prayers being conceived and fram'd by the light and guidance of it, in ſuch ſort, and ſo farre, as it was intended to give light, and regulation in this kind. (For there was ſomething added, at leaſt by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> afterwards, concerning the manner of praying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24.26.) Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I know no ſufficient ground to judge the uſe of it, as a prayer, univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: and he that ſhall thus judge, will put to rebuke the whole generation (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) both of righteous, and learned men, as well in latter, as in more ancient times. For theſe generally conceived that it was very lawful to be uſed as a Prayer, and did (for the moſt part) ſometimes thus uſe it.</p>

                        <hi>What may be the reaſon, why</hi> Chriſt, <hi>delivers his preſcript, or platform of Prayer, in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number,</hi> Our Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Give us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Forgive us, <hi>&amp;c. rather then in the ſingular?</hi>

                     <p>The reaſon very poſſibly may be, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his deſire that his Diſciples and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould love to pray in conſort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and take all opportunities to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meet together about this heavenly exerciſe. The Apoſtles ſeem thus to have underſtood the mind of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43506:121"/> point we ſpeak of. For of theſe it is ſaid; <hi>Theſe all continued with one accord in Prayer and ſupplication, with the women,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of Jeſus, and <hi>with his Brethren, Act.</hi> 1.14 And if it had been delivered in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, it might with as much reaſon have been demanded, why it was not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the plural. For as it is now ungram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and improper, for him that prayeth privately, unleſſe he change the number, ſo would it have been in the other caſe, for thoſe that ſhould pray in company.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 43.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But how can it be looked upon as a perfect, or compleat pattern or platform of Prayer, when as there is nothing in it to direct, or teach men, in what name to pray, which is a matter of as mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and weightie a conſideration about Prayer, as any other thing that is moſt needful to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in it, and is ſupplyed by</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelf afterwards,</hi> Joh. 16 24.26?</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be called a perfect rule, or platform, of Prayer, becauſe it did very ſufficiently and compleatly inſtruct men how to pray with acceptation, at the time when it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and untill God judged it meet that a further and clearer diſcovery ſhould be made, in what name, and upon whoſe account and intereſt, he would be prayed unto by men. For (as was formerly hinted, In the anſwer to the 11th queſtion in this chapter) he that in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43506:122"/> prayer calleth God his <hi>Father,</hi> prayeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely, and conſequentially, in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the believing Jews of old, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this diſcovery was made, and publiſhed in the world, did. The Apoſtles themſelves did not pray in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or diſtinctly, untill after his Reſurrection or at the ſooneſt, a very little while before his death. <hi>Hitherto yee have aſked nothing in my Name:</hi> And, <hi>At that day ye ſhall aſke in my name.</hi> Joh. 16.24.26.</p>

                     <p>The whole is called a Prayer, becauſe the greater part of it is ſuch, containing ſeveral petitions.

                     <p>The heart is then in a meet frame to pray when it is filled on the one hand with the remembrance, or appreheſion of the good will of God towards a man, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, with a like apprehenſion, of his tranſcendent Majeſty and Glory. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrengtheneth Faith, and gives boldneſs; the latter allayeth this boldneſſe with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and fear, and teacheth a man, under that freedome whereunto he is admitted by God, to know and obſerve his due diſtance, notwithſtanding.

                     <p>It is not reaſonable to conceive that <hi>Chriſt</hi> putteth men upon praying in one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or upon any ſervice whatſoever, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefit, or advantage that may poſſibly accrue unto God by it, in one kind, or other. For he is of himſelf, and from himſelf, as bleſſed as bleſſedneſſe it ſelf can make him, full to the brim, as of Goodneſſe, ſo of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and all ſatisfaction, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imaginable, yea and above, and beyond all imagination. Nor can any acceſſion, or addition be made unto his glory by any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from the Creature, though performed with the higheſt hand of wiſdome, zeal, and faithfulneſſe: as neither can he ſuffer the leaſt diminution in his bleſſedneſſe or glory, by the greateſt wickedneſſe that can be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him. The Scripture is expreſſe and full of his truth. <hi>My goodneſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid unto God) extendeth not unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 16.2. <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable to himſelf? Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art Righteous? Or is it gain to him that thou makeſt thy waies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</hi> Job. 22.2, 3. Again, <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him? Or if thy Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be multiplied, what doeſt thou unto him? If thou he righteous, what giveſt thou him? Or
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43506:124"/> what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedneſs may hurt a man,</hi> &amp;c. Job. 35.6, 7, 8. <hi>Neither is he worſhipped with mens hands, as if he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any thing,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 17.25. Therefore when <hi>Chriſt</hi> teacheth us to pray unto God that his <hi>Name</hi> may be <hi>Hallowed,</hi> he rather intendeth the benefit of thoſe that pray, then his to whom the Prayer is made. Beſides, it ſeemeth ſomewhat improper for men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to deal well by himſelf, or to do himſelf right, or the like; unleſſe it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an apprehenſion, that by doing himſelf right, he ſhall in one kind or other, benefit, and accommodate them.

                     <p>By the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of God here, is meant, in a more ſpecial and particular manner, that happy ſtate and condition, which the world ſhall be tranſlated into, when the <hi>Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, (Rev.</hi> 11.15. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Chap. 12.10). For now God ſhall Raign gloriouſly in his Saints and Holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his, and their Enemies, being univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued and put under their feet. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and true holineſſe ſhall lift up their heads on high without any check, or controul or fear of either, from the powers, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the world; for theſe will be nurſing Fathers, and Soveraign benefactors unto them. But in a more general ſenſe, by the <hi>Kingdome</hi>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:43506:126"/> of God may well be meant, all thoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſpenſations of his, which according to his counſell, and thoſe principles of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which rule in all his dealings with the world, are proper to promote and make way for the coming of that Kingdome into the world; and likewiſe all ſuch, which may in the, <hi>interim,</hi> be as a taſt, or firſt fruits of that Kingdome unto the world, as the numerous increaſe of Righteous and Holy men, the giving them credit and countenance from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by bleſſing and proſpering them, and making their Faces to ſhine by cauſing the fear of them to fall upon the men of this world, and for the effecting and bringing to paſſe of theſe things, the pouring out of his Spirit in miniſterial gifts and endowments upon men, and the giving them hearts to ſerve him in this great work, the keeping out, of unlearned, unfaithful, unholy men from this imployment, the advancement of godly wiſe, and worthy men unto places of power and authority (with the like). Theſe are the principal things comprehended in this ſecond Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> and to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by us when we preſent it unto God.</p>

                     <p>The ſtory and caſe of <hi>Job</hi> (not to mention others of like Argument) ſheweth that there lyeth an equal neceſſity upon rich men to pray unto God for the preſervation and ſafe-guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their great eſtates, yea even to ſuch

                     <p>I do not find that <hi>Chriſt</hi> any where diſliked, or rejected men for being Rich: Nay, it is ſaid that he <hi>loved a young man,</hi> that <hi>had great poſſeſſions, Mar.</hi> 10.21, 22. and honoured <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who alſo was rich, with inviting himſelf to his houſe. Yet I find that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he pittieth this Generation of men, as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43506:128"/> being in a moſt ſad and dangerous condition and not in any poſſibility of Salvation, but only by ſome great and more then ordinary interpoſure of God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.23, 24.26 <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.23, 25, 26, 27. Elſewhere I find him, by his Apoſtle, dealing very roundly with them, preſcribing unto them ſeveral receipts (very uncouth and unpleaſing unto the generality of them) as, <hi>not be high minded, not to truſt in uncertain Riches, but in God, to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to diſtribute, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to communicate,</hi> &amp;c. and all theſe things as neceſſary to be done by them, <hi>that they may lay hold on eternal Life</hi> (which otherwiſe is it ſeems, like to paſſe or ſlip, by them, unminded, and unregarded,) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. By another Apoſtle I find him taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the waies and actings of ſuch men, as very wicked, and abhominable in the ſight of God, and which unrepented of, and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, threaten the vengeance of eternal fire. <hi>Do not ri h men oppreſſe you, and draw you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment Seats? Do they not blaſpheme that worthy Name, by which ye are called?</hi> Jam. 2.6, 7. <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep, and howl for your miſeries — Behold the hire of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth, and the cries of them which have Reaped, are entered onto the eares of the Lord of Sabbaoth. Yee have lived in pleaſure on the Earth and been wanton: ye have &amp;c. Jam.</hi> 5.1.4, 5. Now to pray unto God
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43506:128"/> to bring us into ſuch a ſtate and condition, in which it is next to an impoſſibility for any man to be ſaved, yea and which is apt to render men utterly uncapable of Salvation, but only by doing ſuch things, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very grievous and tormenting unto ſuch men to do; And laſtly, which hath this ſad property in it alſo, to make the lives and doings of thoſe that come into it (more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) vile and hateful before God; to pray (I ſay) that God would be the Author of ſuch a condition as this unto us, is (in effect) to pray, that he would lead us into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the very next Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition but one (as we heard and ſhortly God willing ſhall hear further) teacheth us to pray the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would not lead us into Temptation; Beſides if it be unlawful, when Riches do encreaſe, to ſet a mans heart upon them, (as <hi>David,</hi> in that reſpect, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth men to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10.) Surely it is not expedient (at leaſt) to ſet a mans heart upon the increaſing them, or to ſtrive with God in Prayer for them. He was as well a wiſe man, as a Godly, that prayed againſt them. <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches. Prov.</hi> 30.8. Notwithſtanding, it is not (I conceive) the mind of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Petition in hand, to impoſe it upon men as a duty, to limit themſelves ſtrictly to pray for things of preſent neceſſity only, for then they ſhould be bound to pray, not ſo much for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43506:129"/> of God upon their honeſt labours, as for the confinement, or ſcanter meaſure of this bleſſing. For otherwiſe (as the wiſeman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth us) <hi>the bleſſing of God maketh Rich,</hi> Prov. 10.22. and <hi>the hand of the diligent</hi> (he ſaith) doth the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Yea and men ought to be provident and to have an eye to the future, and in ſummer to lay up for winter, and in health and ſtrength, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſickneſſe, and weakneſſe: yea if God hath given us Children, to remember them alſo, and, if he ſhall pleaſe ſo farre to bleſſe us, and give opportunity, to lay up in a convenient meaſure for them. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are expreſſe and clear for theſe things. See at your leiſure <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6. &amp; 14.24. &amp; 15.6. &amp; 20.4 13. &amp; 27.23, 24 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; 28.19. &amp; 13.22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. (with many others) So that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> teacheth us to pray, <hi>Give us this Day our Daily bread,</hi> his meaning and intent ſeems to be, to take men off from minding or looking after ſuperfluities, or the great things of the world, and not to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with God for them, but to leave him to his own Liberty and Pleaſure whether he will beſtow, or caſt in unto us, ſuch things as theſe or no; and to be earneſt with him only for things of preſent neceſſity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience Beſides, the Prayer in hand, being drawn up and formed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the uſe and direction of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was not reaſonable, or meet, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43506:129"/> thing ſhould be found in it, that ſhould occaſion, or lead, men to pray for Riches, or any the great things of the world, but only for things neceſſary and convenient: becauſe ſuch things as theſe, are commodious and beneficial, unto all (without exception) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as neither the heads, nor the hearts of many are able to carrie a full cup without ſpilling; nor to weild great riches, honours, or height of proſperity, without imminent danger of being ruined and undone by them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

                        <hi>What is the meaning of the fifth Petition? and what are ſome of the chief particulars comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it, and which we are directed by it to ask in Prayer of God?</hi>

                     <p>This Petition leadeth us to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our ſelves to be ſinners againſt God; and that whileſt our ſins remain unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, we are in a ſad condition, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the breaking out of his diſpleaſure in one judgment or other (if not in more) upon us (for in this reſpect our ſins are here called our <hi>debts,</hi> or <hi>treſpaſſes,</hi> which unleſſe they be forgiven, will be, we know not how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, required at our hand.) And therefore we are further taught and admoniſhed in this Petition, to pray as conſtantly for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of them as we do for our <hi>Daily bread.</hi> For to aſk it in Prayer of God, is a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43506:130"/> ſpecial means to obtain it, according to what we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32. <hi>I forgave thee all that debt BECA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE thou deſiredſt me.</hi> But we are withall admoniſhed, and directed, to ſeek it of God upon ſuch terms, which if we do nor really and truly perform, we pray, not for the pardon or forgiveneſſe of them, but for the retainment of them, and for the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance due unto them to be inflicted on us. For they that pray thus unto God; <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt us,</hi> if they do not forgive them, pray, that themſelves may be no otherwiſe forgiven; that is not at all. So that the great and ſignal favour, and bleſſing, which this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition leadeth us to ask explicitly and directly of God, is the forgiveneſſe of our ſins; and conſequentially, a gracious exemption from all thoſe evills, judgments, and miſeries, which our ſins have deſerved, together with a free and full injoyment of all thoſe bleſſings and good things, which the infinite goodneſſe, and bounty of God inclineth him to beſtow upon ſuch of his Creatures, who by their love loyalty, and obedience unto him, have found favour in his ſight. The Petition yet further being ſo modelled, as we have heard it is, for the obtaining of the great bleſſing of the forgiveneſſe of our ſins upon our asking it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindeth us to ask likewiſe a merciful, loving, and free ſpirit towards our enemies, and thoſe that have been injurious unto us, in what kind
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43506:130"/> or degree ſoever. For unleſſe we freely, and from the heart, forgive unto theſe all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, wrongs, and unkindneſſes (dammages in ſome caſes only excepted) which they have done unto us, we are not admitted more then the Devills to the favour of petitioning God for the forgiveneſſe of our own ſins, with any hope of having ſuch our Petition granted us. By the way, it is worthy our obſervation, how beneficial enemies, and thoſe that deal unkindly and injuriouſly by us, are, or may be unto us, unleſſe we be farre greater enemies to our ſelves, then they. They afford us the happy opportunity of doing that, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof giveth us a ſteady, and full aſſurance of being accepted with God in our Prayer for the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, and without the performance of which, we are excluded from all hope of prevailing in ſo great a concernment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. and 18.35.</p>

                        <hi>But have they that believe in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>any need to pray for the forgiveneſſe of their ſins?

                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his death, according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and will of God, purchaſed actual pardons of ſin, or pardons of ſin to be actually, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43506:131"/> without any more ado, or requirement of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other termes, or conditions, conferred upon all thoſe that ſhould truly, and with all their heart believe on him. But evident it is from the Scriptures, that he hath ſubjected the injoyment of theſe pardons, as well in reſpect of the continuance of them, as of the extent of the benefit of them, even whilſt they are continued, under certain Proviſo's, or terms of Limitation, as his wiſdome and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the orderly and equitable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and more particularly of his own houſe, directed him to do, being at full liberty to order the great affair we now ſpeak of, as himſelf ſhould pleaſe. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; we find the continuance of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of ſuch a pardon, clearly ſuſpended upon his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> behaviour, who is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſed of it, towards thoſe that have wronged, or dealt unkindly by him, in his free and hearty forgiving them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.27. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>ver.</hi> 28.30.32, 33, 34, 35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.25, 26. So likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perſeverance in Faith, Love, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14 &amp; 6.11, 12. &amp; 10.38, 39. (beſides other places very many). Again, Theſe pardons, in reſpect of their preſent benefit, either in freeing men from inward fears of Gods diſpleaſure, or from outward ſufferings, or puniſhmenrs due unto ſin, are ſuſpended upon the regularneſſe of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43506:131"/> their obedience, their holy and humble walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, their exerciſing themſelves to have alwaies a conſcience voyd of offence towards God, and towards Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The truth hereof, in both particulars, moſt exemplarily and at large, appeareth in <hi>Davids</hi> ſtory, who by reaſon of his breach of Loyalty unto God in thoſe extravagant practiſes and miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, wherein Sathan was above him, was both inwardly afflicted in Soul, and this very ſorely, and alſo purſued from time to time, by and with many outward judgments and ſore afflictions from God, as if he had been in the number of thoſe who never believed, nor had ever been bleſſed with the pardon of their ſins. See (at leaſure) upon this account. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31, 32, 33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, 31, 32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. (with many others) Therefore even they, who believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and upon their believing, were inveſted with the pardon of their ſins, inaſmuch as they ſin daily, notwithſtanding, yea they know not how oft (<hi>for who can underſtand his errors. Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) are greatly concerned to aſk the pardon of their ſins of God from day to day. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, God is at liberty, or rather (indeed) under a neceſſity (in reſpect of his honour) to make them their ſorrow either inward, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or both. And ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath now made it, or declared it, to be a part of the worſhip of God that we daily, or from time to time ask of him the forgiveneſſe of our
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43506:132"/> ſins, they who do not exerciſe themſelves in asking it, herein and to a degree, become prophane, forſaking or neglecting the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and conſequently to a like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, expoſe themſelves to the danger of apoſtacy, and ſo to have the pardon of their ſins cancelled and reverſed, never to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them more.</p>

For it implies that there is but one <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> worthy the name of a Kingdome; and ſo but one <hi>Power,</hi> that deſerves the name of Power; and but one <hi>Glory,</hi> that is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the nature of glory. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> directeth us to aſcribe them all unto God, and to look up unto him, as really, and rightfully, poſſeſſed of them all.

This great body of the Creation, unto God ſtands in the nature, and relation, of a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> becauſe he exerciſeth a juſt Soveraignty, and ſuper-eminent Authority over it, and every member and part of it. Some take the <hi>Kingdome</hi> here in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe, namely for that ſelect and choiſe party of the Creation, which conſiſteth of Elect Angels, and Holy men, over whom God raigneth by his Grace, Word, and Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Kingdome is (indeed) included in the other; but if this were here meant apart from the reſt of the Creation, over which God exerciſeth a Kingly Soveraignty, as well as over it, he muſt be ſaid to have two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and not (emphatically) One.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>THE Power,</hi> is meant that ſtrength, or might, which is appropriate unto God, and which we commonly call omnipotency, that is, all-mightineſſe. This Power may well be called, <hi>THE Power,</hi> becauſe, whether we reſpect either activity, or reſiſtance, all the power that is veſted in the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in all the reſpective parts or members of it, as in Angels, Divels, Men, Hoſts, or Armies of men, ſtones, rocks, hills, mountains ſun, moon, ſtarrs, elements, fire, water, the greateſt breaches or inundations of waters,

                     </p>
                     <p>As before we began to Petition, we were directed (as we have heard) ſo to conceive of God (and to expreſe our conceptions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly) as might incourage us to pray, and yet with reverence; So having finiſhed our work of Prayer, we are directed to repreſent ſuch things unto God, relating to himſelf, which in a reaſonable conſtruction, muſt needs incline him, and this very effectually, to grant us what we have deſired of him: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this repreſentation, or doxology muſt needs be an excellent means to revive and ſtrengthen our Faith concerning a favourable audience, and acceptance with God in our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43506:135"/> Prayer. For our Saviour well knowing that Faith is the principal Verb in the ſentence of Prayer, judged it neceſſary to be well guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both in the Front, and Rere; and hath made proviſion accordingly, by awakening and raiſing up ſuch apprehenſions in us of things relating unto God, both in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and end of his modell of Prayer, which being well and underſtandingly digeſted, muſt needs be as marrow and fatneſſe to the Soul of our Faith. We ſpake formerly of what is found upon this account, in the beginning of the Prayer, in the firſt words, <hi>Our Father.</hi> Now in the cloſe, repreſenting it unto God as a thing well known to us, and believed by us, that His is <hi>THE Kingdome, THE Power,</hi> and <hi>THE Glory,</hi> and all theſe for ever; we humbly ſignifie, and declare unto him, that we have reaſon and ground in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance to believe, that he will give us what we have asked (and are accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to depend upon him for) namely, becauſe he is infinitely and eternally bleſſed, full to the brim of all his capacities, of, and with himſelf: and conſequently, cannot but be moſt propenſe, and ready, yea, zealouſly rejoycingly, triumphantly addicted to do good unto his poor Creatures, when they ſtand in need of him eſpecially when they look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by Faith, and humbly ſeek his face by Prayer. Even a Creature richly apaied with the ſenſe of much contentment in his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43506:136"/> condition? or with the apprehenſion of ſome great felicity come upon him, becomes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by large-hearted, and open-handed, to ſhew any kindneſſe or mercy to thoſe that ſtand in need, and come in his way. The Scripture gives many inſtances ot the truth of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or Obſervation. See at leiſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider diligently theſe Texts (unto which you may add many others of like import) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.22.29, 30. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8.10, 11, <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 4.15. As on the contrary fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience teacheth us that the more diſcontented, and leſſe ſatisfied men, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, are with their conditions, they are the more indiſpoſed to gratifie others in any thing, and (for the moſt part) male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented perſons, are of malefique, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſpoſitions, taking more pleaſure in the troubles, and ſorrows, then in the comforts, or proſperity of other men. The Divel, who looks upon himſelf as the moſt miſerable, and accurſed, of all the Creatures of God, is the firſt born of all that imagine and practiſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt others, and by the cruelty of his malicious endeavours and attempts to draw his fellow-creatures into the ſame wretched condition with himſelf, hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed unto himſelf the names of <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> (<hi>Revel.</hi> 9, 11.) the former being an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the latter a <hi>Greek,</hi> or Gentile, word or name, to ſignifie that the Bow of his devouring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice ſtands bent both againſt Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43506:136"/> that is, the whole world; even as the Son God on the other hand, by deſigning and endeavouring the Salvation, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> (that is of the whole world) hath obtained the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the former, being an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the latter, a <hi>Greek</hi> or Gentile appellation. Therefore God, who muſt needs be infinitely apaied with joy, delight, and contentment in the higheſt, in his condition, knowing himſelf to be poſſeſt of ſuch a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Glory,</hi> as were lately deſcribed, and theſe fully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured unto him to the daies of Eternity, muſt of neceſſity likevviſe be conceived to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, graciouſly, and bountifully inclined, and this in full proportion to the knowledge and ſenſe he hath of his own bleſſedneſſe, to condeſcend to the Prayers and Supplications of his poor creatures, when ever they ſhall call upon him.</p>

And in this conſtruction of it, it importeth as much as, <hi>So

Some conceive it to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty, and required by God, that we uſe or pronounce it, at the end of all the Prayers we make, whether in private, or with others, if we approve them. And ſo in the end of all our doxologies and thanksgivings. There may be a good reaſon aſſigned, why it may be convenient, and thus farre neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be uſed in ſuch caſes, as namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be conceived to anſwer the uſe and intent of a Seal, by which deeds in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are wont to be compleatly ratified. For as a Seal put to a writing, after it hath been made, read, and peruſed is (conſtructively and in effect) an acknowledgment and confeſſion of the party, that he was not prevented or ſurprized, in yielding to, or confirming any thing contained in the writing, but that he hath well weighed and conſidered all things, upon which confeſſion it is moſt equitable that ſuch his deed, ſhould obliege and bind him effectually to the performance of the terms of it: In like manner, when a man hath poured out his Soul in ſeveral Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Requeſts unto God, by concluding all
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43506:138"/> all with the word <hi>Amen,</hi> he declares himſelf to have been thorough-hearted in ſuch his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he at no hand recalls any thing peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for in it, but that upon good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he ſtands faſt and firm by all his ſuits and motions, and is ready to repeat and go over his prayer the ſecond time, in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ardent deſire, to have it granted. For I conceive the word <hi>Amen,</hi> to be (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively) the praying over the prayer made the ſecond time, by him that uſeth it in the cloze thereof. There is much alike conſideration of the word, when uſed after doxologies, and thanksgivings. For here it importeth the full, and free, and redoubled conſent, deſire, and contentment of the heart and ſoul, that God ſhould be praiſed and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as he now hath been, and that he ſhould remain for ever poſſeſſed, and in the full enjoyment of all thoſe <hi>Regalia,</hi> thoſe moſt tranſcendent and adorable Royalties, which have now been been aſcribed unto him. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Prayer in hand, there being a <hi>Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie,</hi> as well as Petitions or a Prayer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before it, the intent of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, that it ſhould relate unto the one, or unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, or unto both indifferently, may be ſome little Queſtion. But ſince (as we have heard) it is congruous and proper unto both; and comprehenſive ſenſes, wherein nothing is forced, are generally to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that are narrower; I conceive it
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43506:138"/> beſt to underſtand it with reference unto both; and to import, that as we are affectuouſly, and ardently deſirous that all the preceeding Petitions ſhould be granted unto us; ſo are moſt joyfully, and with the heighth of all contentment, apaied in heart and ſoul, that God is poſſeſſed of ſuch a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Glory,</hi> as we have now aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him, and that he is ſecured in this his poſſeſſion, and enjoyment <hi>for ever, and ever.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>To look after our Prayers, when we have ſent them up into Heaven, and obſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, for ſome ſpace of time (if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not ſatisfaction ſooner) how they ſpeed and proſper in the things, about which they were ſent. <hi>David</hi> did this, and reſolved to do it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3, 4. Compared with 85.8. There are ſeveral <hi>Chriſtian</hi> commodities that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It ingageth and exerciſeth the mind about God, and particularly about that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Character or property of His, by which he attracts and draws all fleſh unto him; I mean, his property of <hi>hearing Prayer. Pſal.</hi> 65.2. &amp; 34.4, 5. (with many others).</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If we mind our Prayers our ſelves, it muſt needs ſtrengthen the hand of God to mind them alſo. He that neglecteth, or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Prayer when he hath put it into the hand of God, doth (upon the matter) diſclaim or diſown it, and withall ſeems to undervalue the guift and grace of God, by which it was conceived, and preſented to him: all which are much diſobliging unto God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If we ſhall narrowly obſerve what returns are made us from Heaven of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we ſhall be the more able clearly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what we receive from God in anſwer to our Prayers, and what we receive of his favour and good will otherwiſe. And if we ſhall once come clearly to find, that from
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43506:139"/> time to time we receive good things from him upon the account of our Prayers, this will prove a matter of moſt rich conſolation unto us. For as a good and gainful Trade, is a better means of ſubſiſtance then the finding of a purſe of Money upon the way, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of a good Gratuity from a rich Friend, once, or twice, or the like: So when a man comes to know that he may have of the good things of Heaven (as it were) in a way of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffique, or commerce by Prayer, it is a farre greater cheering and raiſing to the Soul, then now and then to receive a Love-Token from God, though of good value. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24 (cited alſo in the Anſwer to the 19th Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in this Chapter).</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He that is intent upon the iſſue and ſucceſſe of his Prayers, declares hereby that he honoureth the promiſes of God made unto Prayer, by believing them, which is a thing well-pleaſing unto God, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his hand to the fulfilling of them, as farre as he that thus acteth, is concerned in them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, (and laſtly) that deportment of Soul we ſpeak of, quickneth and diſpoſeth the heart unto thankfulneſſe, when God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth a mans prayer, and thankfulneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt return which God expecteth from the Earth of thoſe commodities, which he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thither from Heaven, muſt needs put life into the Prayer-Trade driven between
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43506:140"/> God and men, and keep the windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being once open, from ſhutting any more.</p>

Negative Anſwers, for the moſt part, are not long delayed: And when God intends not to gratifie our deſires in Prayer, commonly he gives ſome ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or intimation at leaſt, of his purpoſe in this kind, by one means or other, before we have beſtowed many Prayers on them. It is not, it ſeems, agreeable to the goodneſs, or ſweetneſs of his Nature, to be acceſſary, either to the growth, or long continuance, of any ſuch deſires in his ſervants, which he hath no intent to fulfill. After a third requeſt made by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Satan</hi> ſent, to buffet him, might be made to depart from him, he received an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs from God, by which he plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that it was not his pleaſure therein to hearken unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Anſwers many times are long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and muſt be waited for, and ſought by crying unto God night and day for a large ſeaſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.7. Yea, their coming (as is probable) may be obſtructed, and prevented by a ceſſation of Prayer, before we have a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to deſpair of their coming at all; which the longeſt delay of all is not, whileſt their coming will be beneficial unto us; as appears from the Scripture laſt cited.

They ſhall

                     <p>To allow unto God, with all patience, and contentedneſs of mind, and with cheerfulneſs of ſubmiſſion, His juſt liberty of chooſing his time and ſeaſon, for giving anſwer unto our Prayers and to judge, that it is, or will be, every whit as expedient and profitable (yea, more) for us, that ſuch his anſwer ſhould be reſpited until His time, though this time of his be never ſo much longer, or further off, then ours; as it it would be, in caſe he ſhould, in the giving of it, anticipate his own time, by applying himſelf unto ours, (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that which is preſent). It is (indeed) wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto him to be importuned with the Prayers and Cries of his Saints, night and day, and to have no reſt given him, until he giveth them an anſwer from Heaven unto their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:43506:142"/> But then this importunity muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſpirit of impatience, diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, or unbelief; or from a conceit that they receive damage, or hurt, by being ſo long delayed in the return of their Prayers from God: but either from a deſire to ſtrengthen the hand of God; to give them ſo much the better meaſure in the return of their Prayer when it comes, or from an apprehenſion of the greatneſs of the things, for which they pray: which very poſſibly may be ſuch, that God judgeth it not meet to give, or beſtow them, but upon long waiting, and many Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by fervency of Prayer unto him; Or thirdly, (and laſtly), from a deſire of haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Anſwer from God as much as may be, in a regular and equitable way; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by praying as much, and with as much zeal and ardency of ſoul, in a ſhort time, as according to the uſual and accuſtomed rate of praying, even amongſt the Saints themſelves, men are wont to pray and pray with, in a long time. For, as when Summer-ſeaſons prove extraordinarily hot, the Fruits of the Earth come to their maturity and ripeneſs, and are fit to be gathered, before their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeaſons in ordinary years: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when men ſhall double and treble the ſpiritual heat and fervency of their ſouls in holy addreſsments unto God, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch good things, as they deſire, above what is ordinarily, and at other times, done,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:43506:142"/> either by themſelves, or others, they hereby become ſo much the ſooner ſanctified, and are made the more early, yet regularly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving thoſe good things from the hand of God. Yea, and God ſhall walk by the ſame rule of Righteouſneſſe and equity towards men, when he ſhall open ſpeedily, to thoſe that knock vehemently, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute intermiſſion; and when he makes them ſtay longer, before he opens unto them, who do but knock now and then, and this more faintly.</p>

He, who when he hath once preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſupplications and prayers unto God, taketh his leave of them, as if he never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſee, or hear of them more, doth not ſo much under-value, or neglect his own act, or that which is from himſelf in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as that which is from God in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, and in all thoſe great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes which he hath made unto the due performance of it. It is one thing for a man to take ſhame, and humble himſelf for all his own weakneſſes, and the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his fleſh, in his Prayer: this is meet and neceſſary to be done: but quite another thing, and of a contrary import, to deſpiſe or not to regard or look after his Prayer it ſelf, as if his weakneſſe in praying, muſt needs make the truth and faithfulneſſe of God in his promiſes made unto Prayer, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and weak (for he could expect none other from men) of none effect. God, what by teaching men how to pray, and what by inabling them by his Spirit to pray, and what by granting ſuch mighty powers unto theſe prayers as he hath done, hath enabled them to c eate another, a new kind of Angel, or <hi>miniſtring Spirit,</hi> which is as able to ſerve them, and do as great things for them, both in Heaven, and in Earth, as thoſe <hi>Miniſtring Spirits</hi> (properly ſo called) the elect Angels of God themſelves, are able to doe. Yea that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43506:143"/> new kind of Angel we ſpeak of, Prayer, hath a kind of Authority given unto it by God, over thoſe other Angels; and by the intereſt which it hath, above the other, in him who is the Lord of them both, is able many times to procure it ſelf to be ſerved by them in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and important affairs. Therefore Prayer, though it be in a ſenſe, the Creature of Man, yet being made of the love, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bounty, wiſedome, and power of God, as the conſtituting principles of it, it is too ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and holy to be neglected, or lightly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by man, when once he hath given life, and breath, and being unto it.</p>

                        </gap>hs, ſuch diſcoveries of God, his mind and counſel, laid down in the Scriptures which are proper and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to work and increaſe theſe (reſpectively) in the hearts and ſouls of men, they muſt be diligently inquired and ſought out, and our judgments and conſciences, ſeriouſly, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſſed, urged, and importuned with them accordingly. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> (with the elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) had for ſome good ſpace of time, in great humility, falling on the Earth with his face, and putting duſt on his head, prayed unto God, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might no more turn their backs upon their Enemies, God takes him off from further praying, and puts him upon doing of that which was proper, and requiſite to be done by him, and by the people, that his Petition might, in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regular way, be granted unto him. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Joſhua, <hi>Get thee up: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face? Iſrael hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>

To deſire any thing of God in Prayer, and not to uſe the means created and appointed by himſelf, for the bringing of it to paſſe, is, in effect to deſire him to pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon his own ordinance, and to tend in pieces the covering which with great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43506:146"/> he hath made for his own arme.</p>

                        <hi>What is the fifth (and the laſt) thing, which may damage our Prayers in the hand of God, very much if care be not taken to keep our ſelves free from it?</hi>

                     <p>An impatience, or diſcontentedneſſe of mind, that God doth not as well comport with us in our time, as in the matter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our prayer otherwiſe. He is not (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) offended that we ſhould haſten him all we can, with calling and crying unto him night and day, with all the importunity of asking. But he is offended that we ſhould be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and make our ſelves agrieved, when he, upon reaſons of greateſt weight, and higheſt importance for his own glory, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefit of the world; Yea and our own profit alſo, ſhall for a time, delay the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our deſires. For he ſeldome, or never maketh any <hi>long tarrying,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) with his Anſwers to the prayers of his People but upon one, or more of, and commonly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the ſaid Conſiderations. Now for any man to be diſſatisfied, or froward, becauſe God Will not ſacrifice ſuch high and ſacred concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the ſervice of his petty intereſt, or leſſe conſiderate deſire, is ſuch an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſtrain of diſ-ingenuity, that it is no marvel if the zeal of God towards his prayers be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if not quenched by it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>WHat occaſion, or neceſſity, was there that ſuch a Body, or Syſteme of Precepts, or Commandements as that which is called the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, <hi>ſhould be delivered, or iſſued out by God, either by word of mouth, or writing, unto the World?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although it was not directly, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately delivered unto the world, but unto a ſmall part of it, namely to the Church of God conſiſting, at the time when it was delivered, of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation only, yet it may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough be ſaid to have been delivered unto the world, becauſe this Nation was intruſted with it (as it was with the reſt of the Oracles of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.) For the uſe and benefit of the world; asvvell as for their own: in which reſpect this, together with the reſt of the ſaid Oracles, are by the Apoſtle called, The E;e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or <hi>rudiments of the World.</hi> Coloſſ. 2.8.20.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons and occaſions, for which God was pleaſed to iſſue it forth in words, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43506:147"/> writing unto the world, may be conceived to be theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That men might have a perfect Copy, and of Divine authority, alwaies at hand; by which to correct all thoſe errours and falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſupply all thoſe defacements and blottings out, to enlighten all thoſe obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and uncertainties of words and meaning, which in proceſſe of time, had crept into the firſt writing of this Law in the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men by God, partly through the negligence and careleſsneſſe of men in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this divine abſtract of their Duty, fair and legible within them, partly (and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) through a long accuſtomed boldneſſe and daringneſs in ſinning againſt the expreſſe and clear dictates of it. This was deſigned and intended by God in order to ſome further ends: of which ſome may be touched pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God by making the rule, or law of mans obedience, ſo plain, and publique with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the world, hath taken a courſe to cauſe every man both to know his own ſins better then otherwiſe he was like to have done, and every man likewiſe to take better notice of the abundance of ſin and wickedneſſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the world round about him. <hi>Moreover</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20) <hi>the Law ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> [or rather iterveened, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> between <hi>Adam</hi> with his ſin, and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought upon the world by it, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:43506:147"/> with his righteouſneſſe, and juſtification] <hi>that the offence might abound;</hi> that is, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> might the better appear to have been <hi>aboundant</hi> in evill. So that God might very juſtly; yea equitably ſubject his whole poſterity unto death for it (for the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the <hi>Sinner</hi> curſed declareth ſin to be another manner of thing farre more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and devouring, then otherwiſe men were like to conceive of it) or rather, <hi>that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that ſin might abound</hi> (for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is preſently explained <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) that is, that the guilt of ſin might become, and appear likewiſe, to be much greater, the authority of the Law prohibiting it, being re-inforced a freſh and that immediately, and with ſtupendious miracles, by the great Law-giver himſelf. Elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the ſame Apoſtle informeth us, that <hi>by the Law is the knowledge of ſin</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.) meaning, that very frequently, and in many caſes, men come by means of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to know thoſe waies and actions to be ſinful, which otherwiſe they were like never to have known in that relation. See for this <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. Yet neither is this end of God in delivering his Law in writing, his ultimate end, but ſubordinate, and ſubſervient to ſome others. Therefore</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The giving of the ſaid Law in writing unto the world, by means of that property and ſervice of it laſt mentioned, commendeth the rich grace of God in the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43506:148"/> gift of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> unto the minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men. For the more ſin is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made known in the world, both in the multitude, and heinouſneſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrations of ir, that Grace which taketh it away, and healeth the great Evil brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men by it, muſt needs be diſcovered, and acknowledged, to be the greater. This point of the counſel of God in ſending the Law into the world, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> (I conceive) pointed at by the Apoſtle, in the place lately cited (in part) Rom. 5.20. <hi>Moreover the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> [or interveened] <hi>that the offence wight abound;</hi> [that is, as we before expounded, might appear to be exceeding great] <hi>but where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, the greater <hi>aboundance</hi> of ſin was diſcovered to be in the world, the fuller diſcovery was (conſequentially) made of that ſuper-aboundancie of the grace of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which that <hi>abounding</hi> ſin was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned, pardoned, and done away. And this diſcovery was that, which God aimed at in the other. For the further illuſtration and confirmation of this Reaſon, ſee and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (at leiſure) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, As God by ſending the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world upon thoſe terms, on which it is come, intended the more perfect diſcovery of thoſe ſins, that were, and would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the World (as hath been ſaid) ſo iikewiſe he deſigned by it a more effectual
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43506:148"/> reſtraint of ſinning amongſt men. And this the Law written is proper to effect, partly by inlightening the minds and conſciences of men to know their duties at every turn, which it doth in the directive part of it: partly alſo, and more eſpecially, by threatning and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them under the commiſſion, and guilt of ſin, which it doth by the penalty, and curſe annexed to it. This end of God in giving the Law we ſpeak of, is plainly intimated by the prohibitory, or negative form or tenour, of (well nigh) all the precepts of it: and is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law? It was added</hi> [name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the Goſpel that had been <hi>preached</hi> before <hi>unto Abraham,</hi> ver. 8.] <hi>Becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come, to whom the promiſe was made, &amp;c.</hi> meaning; that notwithſtanding the Doctrine, and ſubſtance, of the Goſpel had been in the world from the daies of <hi>Abraham</hi> (yea and long before) yet by reaſon of the obſcurity of it, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſcovery of the grace vouchſafed in it, untill <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it had little force or efficacy to turn men from their waies of ſin, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. In which reſpect, God being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto the world, and deſirous to ſtop the current of ſin amongſt men, by the beſt means he was able at preſent (for his wiſdome ſuffered him not to ſend his <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the world, untill many generations after) he was pleaſed to give out that <hi>fiery Law</hi> we ſpeak
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43506:149"/> of (as <hi>Moſes</hi> termeth it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the dread and terrour, with which it was given, or for the ſpirituality or ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property of it) unto the world, being [to make it the more effectual for the end we ſpeak of, and more awfull to the conſciences of men; as the Apoſtle addeth] <hi>ordained</hi> [or rather ordered, that is managed, transſacted; and, as it were, put into it's office, inveſted with its Authority, and power] <hi>by Angels,</hi> [one pronouncing it in the name of God; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in great numbers attending and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing the action] and this, <hi>in the hand of a Mediatour;</hi> meaning that God admitting only, <hi>Moſes</hi> (with <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother, who were but as one, in this ſervice) inſtead of the reſt of the people to come near unto him, when the Law was given, and by him char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to keep at a great diſtance from him, plainly ſignified both that the people had about this time, and before, greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him by ſinning; and alſo that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpenſation (the giving of the Law) was not intended for a means of their reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto him, without the interpoſure of a Mediatour between him and them. That the Law doth ſometimes occaſion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto ſin, and not reſtrain from it, is by accident, being contrary to the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Law, and to the primary intent alſo of the Law-giver.</p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:43506:149"/>
                     <p>Fifthly, (and laſtly) the iſſuing forth of the Law unto the World, as in one reſpect (which is accidental to it) it worketh, or cauſeth, <hi>wrath</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>wrath, or wrath</hi> in a greater meaſure; So in another reſpect, more ſutable to the nature of it well conſidered, and according to the gracious intendment of him from whom it came, it is ſerviceable and proper to lead men into ſuch waies by which they may eſcape wrath, and obtain the love and favour of God. For (as the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12.) <hi>The Law is holy, and the Commandement</hi> [that is, every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, or the preceptive part of it] <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and juſt, and good:</hi> and conſequently: can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not directly, or according to its native tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, operate any thing but good, unto men. Now the good intended by God unto Men in giving unto them this Law in writing, was to aſſiſt the Law of nature, or ſo much of this Law, as was yet remaining in them, in three particulars of great concernment unto them, wherein the ſaid Law of nature, as it was now (more generally) wounded, and maimed, was defective and weak. As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when it reſtraineth men from doing evill (wherein as we lately ſhewed it is much more ſerviceable, then the Law of Nature in the remainders of it within men) it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth them from wrath, at leaſt from ſo much of the wrath of God, which would have
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43506:150"/> been the wages of thoſe ſins, had they been committed, from which they have now been reſtrained.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As it teacheth and chargeth men to do their duties, and things pleaſing unto God, it doth that which is proper to intereſs them in the love and favour of God. <hi>For the Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſſe, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, Pſal.</hi> 11.7.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) As it convinceth them notwithſtanding of ſin, and ſo cauſeth them to deſpair of Juſtification in the ſight of God, by their own works, it impoſeth a neceſſity upon them, both to make diligent inquiry whether there be not a means vouchſafed by God for their Juſtification (notwithſtanding) and likewiſe, in caſe they find that ſuch a means there is, that they imbrace it with all readineſſe, not diſputing the termes hereof, whatever they be, further then only to know them. And thus we ſee the truth of what ſome have affirmed; <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods ends in giving the Law, where Evangelical.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>What is that ſmall part, or piece of Scripture which is frequently called the</hi> Decalogue, <hi>(that is, the Ten words, (Deut. 10.4.) or a diſcourſe or ſpeech, conſiſting of Ten words) commonly</hi> The Ten Commandements?</p>

                     <p>Queſt. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether doth the Decalogue, as adminiſtred by</hi> Moſes, <hi>concern Chriſtians, ſo as to bind their conſciences to the obſervation of it?</hi>
                     </p>

For if it be granted, Firſt, That the Decalogue proceeds from God: and Secondly, is upon this account, obliging upon the conſcience of Chriſtians, it is not material, nor (indeed) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or worthy a man of competent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ask, whether it bindeth him as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Moſes?</hi> For neither did it bind the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſimply as delivered unto them by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> no nor yet if we ſpeak ſtrictly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as delivered unto them by <hi>Moſes</hi> from God, but as proceeding, obligation-wiſe upon them, from God; and would have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually binding unto them, had it been ſent in like manner, or upon the ſame or the like termes of conviction that it did come from God, by the hand or miniſtry of any other
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:43506:151"/> perſon whatſoever as well as <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But how can the Law we ſpeak of (the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue) be at all, or in any reſpect, binding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſciences of true</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>when as the Apoſtle adminiſtreth this comfort, in expreſs words unto them, that they</hi> are not under the Law, but under Grace, Rom. 6.14. <hi>And elſewhere he ſaith,</hi> that, the Law is not made for <hi>[or, not given unto, as the former tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath it]</hi> A Righteous man, but for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and diſobedient, for the ungodly and ſinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>True <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or Believers, are ſaid not to be under the Law, becauſe they are not under the curſe, or condemning power of the Law, or becauſe they are not at the mercy of the Law for their juſtification; not becauſe they are not bound in conſcience to obſerve, and do the things required in the Law. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they were not liable to offend, or to do any thing that is ſinful, which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the current of the Scriptures; theſe from place to place affirming, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers themſelves offend, and do things that are ſinful, and withall, that ſin is a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3, 4. Beſides, the Apoſtles often preſſe the Authority of the Law to perſwade Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to do their duty, and to convince and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43506:151"/> reprove them for the neglect hereof. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. &amp; 14.34. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8.9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>When it is ſaid, the <hi>Law is not made for a Righteous man, but &amp;c.</hi> the meaning is, The Law as it was delivered upon <hi>Mount Sina,</hi> accompanied with a Spirit of Bondage, and with a grievous penalty, or curſe (annexed) againſt thoſe that ſhould tranſgreſſe any jot or title of it, was not ſuited, or fitted by God, to the ſtate and condition of Righteous and Holy men, as ſuch who thus farre and in this conſideration (namely, as they are righteous) need no urging, or terrifying with threatnings, to do the things required in the Law, being by an inward principle ſtrongly inclined hereunto; but unto the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of perſons <hi>lawleſſe and diſobedient &amp;c.</hi> that is, which live looſely, wickedly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely, as if they had no law at all within them, either to inform them of what was meet and fitting for them to do, or to reſtrain them from doing evill. In which reſpect they have need of ſuch a Law without them, which on the one hand, might be full of light to teach them their duty, and on the other hand, full of dread and terrour, to reſtrain them from doing things contrary unto it. Some interpret the place thus, <hi>The Law is not made for the Righteous,</hi> that is, not for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Righteous, or that righteous men might merit either juſtification, or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43506:152"/> by the obſervation of it (in which ſenſe it ſeems to have been taught, and urged by the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors,</hi> againſt whoſe Doctrine the Apoſtle cautioneth <hi>Timothy, ver.</hi> 6.7.) <hi>but for the Lawleſſe, &amp;c.</hi> that is, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and reformation of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons, that they, through the dread of the vengeance, or curſe, denounced in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſinfull waies perſiſted in, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible how great a neceſſity lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to take ſanctuary at the Goſpel, and to flee for refuge under the wing of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by believing.

                     <p>There can be no other kind of Faith requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, properly, and directly, in the Moral Law then what was required of man immediately upon his Creation, and during his ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, becauſe this Law (at leaſt ſo farre as it is moral) hath ſuffered no alteration, or change, ſince the firſt writing of it by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, as the Author of nature, in the fleſhy tables of the heart of man. Now that kind of Faith, which ſince his fall, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him in his juſtification, ſuppoſeth him to be a ſinner, and conſequently ſendeth him out of himſelf unto another for his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea unto the ſufferings of another, or unto another that hath ſuffered for him. But ſuch a Faith as this could not be required of him to his State of Righteouſneſſe, or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, becauſe whileſt this continued, he was no ſinner, nor did he ſtand in any need of ſeeking juſtification by another. Nor (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) during the time and ſtate we ſpeak of, was there any Faith at all, of one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, required of him (properly) for his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but only for the continuance of his juſtification. For he was in poſſeſſion of a ſtate of Juſtification, untill he caſt himſelf out of this poſſeſſion, by ſinning voluntarily. And that Faith, which in conjunction with
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43506:153"/> other duties or works of the Law in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſeaſons, was required of him for the continuance of his juſtification, was not a Faith of like Character, or Notion, with that which now juſtifieth: it was not a Faith in God, that he would juſtifie him freely through the Redemption which is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> nor an aſſent unto any promiſe made by God for the juſtification of him upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch, or ſuch terms: but ſuch a Faith, whereby he believed God to be every waies as great in holineſſe, in truth, in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in all manner of perfection, as he had by the light of nature, revealed himſelf unto him to be. From whence (by the way) it is obſervable, that Man did not by his fall in <hi>Adam</hi> loſe any ability, or power, to believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto juſtification; (For how could he loſe that in <hi>Adam,</hi> which neither <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall, nor he in <hi>Adam</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received?) and conſequently, that this Faith is not now required of men upon the account of any ability given unto them under the firſt covenant (of works) or received in <hi>Adam,</hi> but upon the account of ſuch abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or power which is given unto them by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> under the ſecond Covenant (of Grace).</p>

                        <hi>But if juſtifying Faith be not commanded in the</hi> Decalogue, <hi>or Morall Law, how can this Law be ſaid to be perfect, or a perfect Rule of

                     <p>The <hi>Decalogue</hi> is a perfect rule of all Moral duties, which are <hi>naturally</hi> ſuch, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting God, our neighbour, or our ſelves: but there are ſome duties which are termed <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> Moral, which become ſuch by inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſpecial command, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> that is, which could not by the light of reaſon, or force of conſcience be diſcovered there, or made out from thence, to be things required of us: nor would they have been duties, or things required of us by God, had he not given par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge, or commands concerning them over and beſides the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> But though they be not required, or commanded in, or by the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or Moral Law, yet they are, and well may be termed Moral in a ſenſe or in a particular reſpect as (namely) <hi>poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>inſtitutedly Morall;</hi> becauſe being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, though not in the Moral Law, yet are men bound to the performance of them by that obligation unto God in things appertaining to him, which the Moral Law impoſeth on them. Hence it is, that though to believe the Goſpel be not enjoyned by. God in the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> yet being otherwiſe required, or injoyned, by him, he that doth not believe it, <hi>maketh God a Lyar</hi> (as <hi>John</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:43506:154"/> ſaith 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10.) which is a tranſgreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Morall Law, being contrary to that moſt honourable and reverend eſteem of the Truth and faithfulneſſe of God, which the Moral Law requireth of all men in the firſt Commandement of it. As on the other hand, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaith of him that believeth the Goſpel, that he hath <hi>ſet to his Seal that God is true</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.33.) that is, hath given a full teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth and faithfulneſſe, of God, which is a duty required of every man by the Morall Law. Thus all the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, during the time that God was pleaſed they ſhould continue, were poſitively Morall unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom they were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by him: and if they had neglected, or omitted any of them in their ſeaſon, they had tranſgreſſed, not only the ceremonial Law; by which they were particularly enjoyned, but the Moral Law alſo, by which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth both them and all men, to worſhip him with that worſhip which himſelf direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and preſcribeth unto them, There is the ſame conſideration of the Sacraments, and their Adminiſtration and uſe in the Goſpel. Now juſtifying Faith, or to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is a duty of that kind we now ſpeak of, (as was lately intimated) <hi>viz.</hi> poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Morall, and is not to be reckoned, or found amongſt the Duties that are naturally ſuch, and are commanded in the Decalogue or Moral Law: which though it be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43506:155"/> rule in its kind, and fully ſufficient for the ends for which it was given, yet is it not abſolutely, or in all reſpects perfect: for then there had been no need of any additional pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in the Goſpel.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But if juſtifying Faith be not required in the</hi> Morall Law, <hi>whether is it at all required of the Heathen, who ſeem to be under the command of this Law only, and this only as it is written in their hearts and conſciences, and not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the Goſpel?</hi>

                     <p>God in the Goſpel ſpeaketh immediately and directly unto thoſe only, who live under the miniſtrie of it, or who have the letter of it, and withall are capable of underſtanding it: and unto theſe, and concerning theſe he declareth plainly &amp; clearly, upon what tearms he is pleaſed to juſtifie and to ſave them; and again, upon what, he will do neither. Concerning others, as Children before years of diſcretion, perſons deſtitute of the ordinary light of nature in their underſtandings (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this hath befallen them by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as of ſickneſſe, or other providence; or is occaſioned by ſome defect in their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or corporeal Organs) and ſo likewiſe concerning Heathens, amongſt whom, or near unto whom, the Letter or Miniſtry of the Goſpel never came, he hath diſcovered his mind and counſell touching their, both
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:43506:155"/> juſtification, and ſalvation, ſomewhat more ſparingly: Nor is it eaſie to evince from the Scriptures ſo plainly and diſtinctly upon what tearms he purpoſeth to proceed with theſe in the great concernments mentioned, but that ſome doubt may ſtill remain. And of all the three ſorts of perſons named, the caſe of the third and laſt (the Heathen) ſeems to be moſt obſcure. Notwithſtandiug theſe ſeven parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars relating to it, are (to me) unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That God really and truly deſireth their Salvation, at leaſt ſimply conſidered, or as men, or members of mankind. This is fully evident from theſe places (with many others) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That as <hi>of him, unto whomſoever much is given, much will be required</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to his Salvation) (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48.) ſo by the rule of equity, and proportion, to whomſoever little or leſſe is given, little or leſſe will be required of him. This agreeth with that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That there is no perſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but hath received a Talent, one, or more by a diligent and conſcientious uſe and improvement whereof, he ſhall be accepted with his Lord and Maſter. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14, 15. <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>Fourthly, That in every Nation, <hi>he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſſe, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him,</hi> Act. 10.35.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That the <hi>forbearance,</hi> and <hi>long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe of God, which leadeth men</hi> (that is, is apt and proper to lead men, yea and doth actually lead, or bring ſome men) <hi>unto Repentance</hi> [and conſequently to bleſſe them with the great bleſſing of forgiveneſſe of ſins, or juſtification, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.] hath alwaies been, and is yet daily exerciſed, towards and amongſt the Heathen.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That though there be neither Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor Juſtification, in, or by any other then <hi>Chriſt</hi> only, (<hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.) Yet both the one, and the other, may be obtained by him, without the knowledge of him, or belief in him, by name; and that the generality of the godly <hi>Jews</hi> of old, were both juſtified and ſaved by him upon theſe tearms, neither knowing him, nor believing in him, by his Name.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, (and laſtly) that though many Heathens have neither heard the ſound, nor ſeen the ſight of the letter of the Goſpel, yet there is none of them but have frequently had the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43506:156"/> Yea that <hi>patience and goodneſſe</hi> of his, which he exerciſeth liberally towards them from day to day, and by which he leadeth them unto <hi>Repentance</hi> (as we lately heard) is, conſtructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preaching, or a providential preaching of the Goſpel, or an holding forth of terms of reconciliation unto them. The reſult from theſe particulars is, that the Heathen are in ſome reſpect under the charge and command of the Goſpel (being all <hi>commanded to Repent, Act.</hi> 17.30.) and not altogether, or only, under the rigorous and exacting power of the Morall Law: and conſequently that ſuch a Faith is required of them, which God will impute unto them for Righteouſneſſe, as he imputeth the Faith of thoſe, who live under the Orall Miniſtry of the Goſpel unto them, although it be not ſo well formed, ſo articulate and diſtinct as this. I might here add, that it is the more generall, and declared opinion of the beſt Proteſtant writers, even theirs who are more hardned in their judgments againſt the Heathen then ſome others, as well as of the ancient Fathers, that God hath ſome that are his, and that ſhall be ſaved, in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Heaven. This conceſſion ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that God doth not bind himſelf with ſo much ſeverity to the Orall Miniſtry, or viſible letter of the Goſpel, but that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worketh in men ſuch a Faith which will both juſtifie and ſave them, by preaching it unto them by the light of nature, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43506:157"/> and bountifulneſſe of his providence, and works of Creation.</p>

God's intentions in ſending <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the world, were Evangelical and gracious, in the higheſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf declaring them accordingly: <hi>For God ſent not his Son into the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved:</hi> Joh. 3.17. Yet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43506:157"/> place he ſaith, <hi>For judgment am I come into this world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39, And <hi>Simeon</hi> concerning him, whileſt he was yet a child: <hi>Behold this Child is ſet for the fall, and riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of many in Iſrael, and for a ſign which ſhall be ſpoken againſt, Luk.</hi> 2.34. Gods <hi>ſending Chriſt</hi> into the world, was a proper diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and means to ſave thoſe that ſhould believe on him, and it was no leſſe proper to render thoſe inexcuſable &amp; worthy death that ſhould reject him. Therefore the Salvation of ſome, and the judgment or condemnation of others are both aſſerted as the intentions of God in that great diſpenſation of ſending him: but the former, the Salvation of men, as his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, or antecedent intention: the latter the Condemnation of men, as his ſecondary, or ſubſequent. In like manner, the giving of that Law, being a diſpenſation, and means, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per both to awaken the conſciences of men that are yet in their ſins, to conſider that they are under the curſe of God, and ſo to provoke them to inquire after a way of deliverance, and when they have found it, to walk care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſcientiouſly in the preſcripts of it; and likewiſe to feal up and fully ratifie the condemnation of thoſe, that ſhall deſpiſe the Goſpel, or neglect to make diligent ſearch how to eſcape the curſe, ſo peremptorily denounced in the Law againſt them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Concerning the Preface prefixed before ths <hi>Decalogue,</hi> although in the litteral and typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe and ſignification of the words, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth particularly unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only people, whom God <hi>had brought out of the Land of Egypt, out &amp;c.</hi> Yet in the myſtical and ſpiritual import of them, which is ſufficiently declared and aſſerted in the Goſpel, and which is the farre more eminent conſideration of them, the ſaid Preface con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth matter of an equall ingagement unto obedience lying upon all other Nations in common with the <hi>Jews.</hi> For deliverance from under the power and tyranny of Sin, Sathan, Death, Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is typically held forth in the great and famous deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from under the Tyrannical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and out of the iron furnace of

                        <hi>But what may be the reaſon why God ſhould ſeek to ingage the</hi> Jews <hi>to own him for their God and to yield obedience unto his Laws, by mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the act of his Grace and Power towards them in</hi> bringing them out of the Land of Egypt, &amp;c. <hi>rather then by inſiſting upon his farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obliging grace and favour unto them, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them from ſin, and from the curſe due unto it, and a thouſand bitter and moſt grievous things following it?</hi>

                     <p>The wiſdome of God judged it meet to reſerve the clear and open-faced diſcovery of the Goſpel, and of the great work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he ſhould come into the world (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.1. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5.) So that though the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was preached unto, and amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at, and before, the time of the giving of the Law (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.6.) yet was it prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto them with much reſervedneſſe of the luſtre, beauty, and brightneſſe of it: God ſent it unto them in ſuch an habit, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> was in, when ſhe met <hi>Iſaack, covering her ſelf with a vail, Gen.</hi> 24.65. This (probably) is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43506:159"/> the reaſon why God was pleaſed to make uſe rather of the ſhadow then of the ſubſtance, of their great deliverance by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to inſure, if it might be, their free and willing obedience unto his Law: and this the rather, becauſe the ſhadow we ſpeak of (their deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi>) was a moſt ſacred token, or pledge from Heaven newly ſent and received by them of his great reſpects, and favour unto them. And inasmuch as this people were to be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and enſamples, and to lead the way of obedience unto the Law of God, to the reſt of the world, it may be judged worthy the goodneſſe of God towards them, to animate and enliven their obedience unto it by remin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them of ſuch an high-favour and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was appropriately theirs; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all knowing their temper of being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taken with propriety in their priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and favours from God.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether is the</hi> Decalogue, <hi>or Morall Law (more generally ſo called) Morall throughout (I mean, naturally Morall) in every thing that is contained, or expreſſed in it? Or, may it not be termed</hi> Moral, <hi>becauſe it is more generally, though it be not univerſally, or in every point, ſuch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe the queſtion doth not mind any other of the Ten words, or Commandements of this Law, or any thing mentioned, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, but only the Fourth, and in
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43506:160"/> this, more eſpecially the Day, the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> here commanded to be ſanctified, or kept holy. That the obſervation, or keeping ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this day, according to the tenour and rule of the Commandement, (as <hi>viz.</hi> by refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, and by reſtaining others that are under us, from ordinary labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor at this day is known by the light of nature to be a duty required by God of men, is moſt probable and next to that which is unqueſtionable: For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The ground, upon which God builds his Commandement for the obſervation of this day <hi>viz.</hi> his reſting on this day from his ſix-days work about the Creation, is not known, nor knowable, by the light of nature. The Scripture expreſly ſaith, that <hi>By Faith</hi> [that is, by divine Revelation, and the credit we give here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to] <hi>we underſtand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. Heb.</hi> 11.3. If the framing of the worlds by the word of God be not known by the light of nature, much leſſe is the time that he took to finiſh it, or on what day he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this work, known unto men by this light.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is expreſſe mention made (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2, 3.) of the ſpecial interpoſure of God by way of Inſtitution, to make the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this day to become a duty unto men. <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it,</hi> becauſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no ſuch courſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with any other of the duties enjoyned in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43506:160"/> all the reſt of the commandements, to bind the practiſe of them upon the conſciences of men: Therefore the obſervation of the day pointed unto in this fourth commandement, is a duty of a different nature and conſideration from thoſe required in the other commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they being all naturally Morall, this only ſuch by inſtitution, or particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If the obſervation of the ſeventh day we ſpeak of, were naturally Moral, as the duties of the other Commandements, and ſo of perpetual obligation, as they are, the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (generally) and all the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> throughout all ſucceeding ages, untill now, muſt be cenſured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as living, and dying, and this (as is moſt likely) without Repentance, in a ſinful practiſe againſt the light of nature: which is an hard ſentence, and hardly Chriſtian, for an inconſiderable party of men to paſs upon the great Congregation of the firſt-born in al their Generations. For it is ſufficiently known that theſe did not walk in the obſervation of that day, but of another inſtead of it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is hardly to be thought, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and yet much harder to be proved, that there was ever any thing written by God in the fleſhy tables of mens hearts which was legible by the light of nature; but that it hath been, by one or other, at one time or other, actually read by this light. The Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43506:161"/> that the Gentiles, which have not the Law do, or may <hi>do, by nature the things contained in the Law</hi> [meaning, the things in the Law, which are <hi>naturally Moral</hi>] hereby <hi>ſhewing the work,</hi> or effect, <hi>of the Law, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. But never (I believe) was there any thing done by the light of nature, no not amongſt thoſe in whom this light ſhined in her greateſt, brightneſſe, by which it may appear that they were led by the guidance of this light, to the obſervation of the ſeventh day, which the fourth Commandement injoyneth. It is not unlike but that ſome of the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Poets, amongſt the Heathen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inquiſitive after the learning, manners, and practices of Forraign Nations, (as many of them were) did by hear-ſay, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notions, Doctrines, and Cuſtomes, (expreſſe mention whereof is found in ſeveral of their writings) come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they (the <hi>Jews</hi>) held, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed about the ſeventh, or Sabbath-day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and did accordingly inſert ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of their knowledge in this kind, in their writings, as <hi>Heſiod, Homer, Callimachus,</hi> and others. But nothing can be ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably concluded from hence, that therefore they knew anything by the light of nature, concerning the holineſſe, which God by ſpecial inſtitution (as we heard) hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſeventh day, of which the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43506:161"/> ſpeaketh: much more probable it is that they might have ſome glimmerings of an apprehenſion, that ſuch a proportion of time, as one day in ſeven, was reaſonable and fitting for intermiſſion of bodily labours, that they might be at liberty to attend upon reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious affairs. But unleſſe we ſhall ſuppoſe, that (which I ſuppoſe was never ſuppoſed, or affirmed by any) it may be known by the light of nature how long God was in creating the world, and that he was ſix daies preciſely, neither more nor leſſe, imployed therein, it is not imaginable that by this light it ſhould be diſcovered unto any man, that the day ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Commandement, ſhould be ſanctified by God for Religions ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, rather, or before, any other.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If it be to be found written in the book of Nature, that the day defined in the fourth Commandement, ought, according to the will of God, to be religiouſly obſerved above other daies, then whatſoever, ſaid, or done, is of a direct tendency to take away this honour from it, and to caſt it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, muſt needs be ſinful. This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is of unqueſtionable truth: becauſe the contents of the book of nature are nothing but the unchangeable righteouſneſſe of God. But ſeverall things have been both ſaid and done, without ſin, of a direct tendency to alter the religious property of that day, and to give it to another: Therefore the religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43506:162"/> of this day is not naturally Moral. The truth of the latter propoſition is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Scriptures, where ſeveral things are found of a direct tendency to invite and perſwade men to ſubſtitute another day, in the place of that, for their Religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p>Not to inſiſt upon thoſe places and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Old Teſtament, in which many of the learned Fathers apprehended, that there was a plain Overture given, even in thoſe daies, that there ſhould be a change of the <hi>Judaical Sabbath,</hi> or ſeventh day; into the eighth, by the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> as, in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumciſion on the eighth day, ſo in the Title of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> entituled, <hi>Pro Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavâ,</hi> for the eighth, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. &amp; 12.); in the number of the ſouls that were ſaved in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, which was eight; again in that of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 43.27. (which hath more light in it then the reſt) <hi>And when theſe daies are expired, it ſhall be that upon the eighth day, and SO FORWARD, the Prieſts ſhal make your burnt offerings upon the Altar, and your peace offerings, and I will accept you, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Some are confident that <hi>David</hi> propheſied of this eighth day, as to be made Sacred by the Lord <hi>Chriſt: This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it. Pſal.</hi> 118.24. Some likewiſe conceive that the ſame Prophet looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſemblies that ſhould
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43506:162"/> meet on the Lords day; in theſe words: <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the Beauties of holineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. And laſtly, ſome argue to the ſame point (and this with no ſlender probability) thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Haggee</hi> (the Apoſtle himſelf much favouring their deſign in this kind by his citation and application of the words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26.) <hi>Yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, &amp;c. Hag.</hi> 2.6. I only mention theſe things, as judged, by men of great ſanctity, and deep inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures, ſufficient overtures from God given long ſince unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> of his purpoſe to give them another day in exchange for their ſeventh-day Sabbath, in due time. And, that the bleſſing and holineſſe of this day are transferred by God, and his Authority, unto another day, even that which ſtands next to it; and from the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hath been known by the name of, The <hi>Lords day;</hi> the Goſpel to an unbiaſſed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and attentive conſcience, maketh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Our Saviour taketh notice of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and manner obſerved by men, who make Weddings, or other great Feaſts, that in caſe a perſon leſſe honorable be placed in the uppermoſt room, and a perſon more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then he cometh, the maker of the Feaſt deſireth the former to give place unto the latter, the leſſe honorable unto the more
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:43506:163"/> honourable, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 14.8, 9.) which is but reaſon, and conſonant to the light of nature: in like manner the Raiſing up of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead being a greater and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Atchievement, or act of God, then the Creation of the World; it is but good reaſon to conceive that God ſhould cauſe the former to give place unto the latter, and to deliver up to the day hereof, that honour of bleſſing and ſanctification, which the day of its remembrance had received from him. Nor is it meet to think, that God who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth men to give <hi>honour to whom honour belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7) ſhould himſelf give honour where leſſe honour is due, and deny it where it is due in a farre greater meaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If Gods reſt, or refreſhing, after, or upon, the finiſhing of the work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was a ground, or motive unto him (as the expreſſe letter of the Commandement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to have been) of his Separating and ſanctifying a day for a memorial of it; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably judge, or with the ſalvage of the unchangeableneſſe of God, but that his pleaſure, acquieſcence, and reſt, in his raiſing of his only begotten Son from the dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a more precious and dear reſentment unto him then the other, ſhould be honoured with a day of a Solemn and Sacred remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance as well as it. Yea and inasmuch as he did not judge it meet, or agreeable to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43506:163"/> and goodneſſe, to devote or ſanctifie any greater proportion of time for reſt, and religious occaſions, then one day in ſeven (or every ſeventh day ordinarily) leſt men ſhould be ſtraightned for time in their ordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, and imployments: and conſidering withall, that the day of his reſt from the works of Creation, had now lived in honor through many Generations, yea for ſome thouſands of years, his pleaſure was, not to conſecrate another or a new day, but to take off the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of this honour from the ſhoulder of that day, and to lay it upon the day of his Sons Reſurrection,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Jews</hi> did nothing, no not in the leaſt circumſtance, of time, or otherwiſe, about the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but what <hi>the hand and counſel of God had determined before to be done</hi> [that is, to permit to be done] <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28. Now then, if the Counſell and purpoſe of God had been to continue, or eſtabliſh, the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> under the Goſpel, and to make that <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> would he not have ſo interpoſed by his providence about the time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, that the third day, the day of his riſeing from the dead, ſhould have been that day, I mean the laſt, not the firſt day of the week? For had it been ordered thus, there had been no place left for any ſcruple, or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about the alteration, or continuance of the day. And I make little queſtion, but that as it was providentially ordered by God
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43506:164"/> that he ſhould remain in the hands of death, ſo long as, and no longer then, now he did, that ſo the Scriptures might be fulfilled in his <hi>riſing again the third day</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 4.) So likewiſe the time, or day, of his dying was by the ſame hand ſo diſpoſed, that the third day after the day of his riſing again, might be the eighth day from the Creation (that is, the firſt day of the week) that the Scriptures herein alſo might be fulfilled, which (as we lately ſhewed) did foretell, though ſomewhat darkly, his riſing again on this day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, From ſundry paſſages of Scripture we learn, that it hath been a thing frequent with God, and practiſed by him from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to conſult and provide for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and honour of his great, and moſt conſiderable actions whether performed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himſelf, and with the unbare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own arm, or mediately by men, through his ſpecial interpoſure and ſtrength, partly by ſetting himſelf ſome Character of ſolemnity upon the time, or day of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective atchievements, partly by teaching and prompting men by his Spirit to do it. Peruſe at leiſure, and conſider (upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gen,</hi> 2, 3. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Exod</hi> 13.3, 4, 6.10. <hi>Eſther.</hi> 9.20.21, 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.22. Now it is true, that for the remembrance with honour of his other great works, he judged an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, that is, one yearly ſolemnity, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43506:164"/> for the reaſon (I ſuppoſe) lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (namely, becauſe he would not by too frequent avocations to religious ſervices, make any wider breach upon mens time for their ſecular imployments then was needful), Only for that moſt ſignal and glorious work of the Creation, he judged a weekly ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity but convenient and meet. Now then it is in no degree probable, that God ſhould bring forth the firſt-born of his works, a work ſo ſuper-tranſcendently glorious and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the raiſing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead, and leave it unto the world without the ſpecial and appropriate ſolemnity of a day for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it; an honour which (as we have heard) he hath not judged meet to deny unto other of his works of a farre inferiour conſideration unto this. But certain it is, that there is no day, at leaſt, no weekly day (and an anniverſary is much beneath it) characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized with any bleſſing from God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this work of his, though it hath the preheminence amongſt and above all its fellows, unleſſe it be concluded, that He, or men authorized by him in that behalf, have taken the Crown of Bleſſing, which was firſt ſet upon the head of a former <hi>Sabbath</hi> and hath herewith Honored and Crowned the day of this great and bleſſed Work. And</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, (and laſtly) that this hath been done both by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, upon, and after, his reſurrection, and by his Apoſtles, who by their
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43506:165"/> example have more then invited, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly engaged, the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world after them to the obſervation of this day, is ſufficiently manifeſt by the light of ſundry paſſages in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf began to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and ſolemnize the day we ſpeak of, on the individual day of his Reſurrection, by an holy and Heavenly conference with ſome of his Diſciples upon the way; and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Sacrament afterwards (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding probable, and was the ſenſe of ſome of the Fathers, and is argued and concluded by many Arguments by ſome (though deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others) from theſe words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.30. <hi>And it came to paſſe as he ſate at meat with them, he took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake, and gave to them.</hi>) And it is very conſiderable to the caſe in hand, that the Evangeliſt being to relate thoſe Sabbath-like works of <hi>Chriſt</hi> mentioned in the entrance of his Relation, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. gives ſpecial notice of the <hi>day</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were wrought by him. <hi>And behold, two of them went THE SAME DAY,</hi> &amp;c. namely, that very <hi>firſt day of the Week,</hi> on which <hi>Chriſt</hi> aroſe from the dead, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 1. with the context along to the 13th. <hi>ver.</hi> Now there can (I ſuppoſe) no reaſon of moment be given why the Holy Ghoſt ſhould give ſuch particular knowledge of the day, on which the two Diſciples travailed to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> but only to ſignifie that Chriſt on this
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43506:165"/> day began to ſanctifie the day of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by his example in religious exerciſes, and to lead the way to all that ſhould believe in him, to do likewiſe. Again</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of another appearance of Chriſt unto his Apoſtles aſſembled together on the ſame day towards the evening, and of ſundry gracious applications of himſelf unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.19, 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who likewiſe gives double notice (as it were) of the day wherein theſe things were done. <hi>Then the ſame day at evening</hi> [that is, in the latter part of the day natural, which the <hi>Jews,</hi> midday being paſt, were wont to call, Evening] <hi>being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſſembled, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 19. Having ſufficiently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the day of this appearance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Then the ſame day,</hi> why he ſhould add, <hi>being the firſt day of the week,</hi> hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reaſon can be given, but only to commend in ſpecial manner unto <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the remembrance of this day, the firſt day of the week; as having now ſomewhat more then ordinary put upon it.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43506:166"/> with the former, not mentioning any thing either ſpoken or done by him, in any of the ſix daies between. <hi>And after eight dayes</hi> he reckoneth incluſively, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.28.

In the firſt of theſe Texts, we read, <hi>And upon the firſt day of the Week, when the Diſciples came together</hi> [meaning, after their uſual and accuſtomed manner] <hi>to break bread</hi> [that is, to adminiſter and partake of the Lords Supper, as Expoſitours generally and without ſcruple interpret] Paul <hi>preache un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43506:166"/> them, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond, the Apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> thus, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</hi> The notation of the circumſtance of time in both theſe paſſages, would be very impertinent, and without all favour of edification, unleſſe it be ſuppoſed that the intent and purpoſe of the Holy Ghoſt herein, was, to commend the day ſpecified, upon ſome ſpecial account unto Chriſtians: Which is not lightly imaginable what other it ſhould be, but to give them to underſtand, that this was the day weekly obſerved by Chriſtians: in theſe times to meet together (in their holy Aſſemblies) as they had been directed and taught both by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf (of which we ſpake lately) and likewiſe by precept from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, by whoſe Authority and direction all things, appertaining to Government, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in and about the worſhip of God in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, were eſtabliſhed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Nor can there any good reaſon be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why the Holy Ghoſt, in both the places mentioned, ſhould not as well have recorded and directed, the day of the month (together with the notation of the Month it ſelf) as the day of the week, had there not been ſomewhat more edifying and conſiderable in the one, then in the other.</p>
                     <p>For the third (and laſt) of the three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43506:167"/> the contents of it are theſe: <hi>And when the daies of Pentecoſt were fully come, they were all with one accord in one place</hi> [meaning, all the Apoſtles with the other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that conſorted with them, to the number of an hundred and twenty, Cap. 1.15.] <hi>And ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly there came a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind — And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> That the day, on which the magnificence of Heaven rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over the world to ſend the Holy Ghoſt down unto it in that miraculous manner, which is recorded in the former part of this Chapter, was the firſt day of the week, though it be not in ſo many words affirmed by the Holy Ghoſt, yet may it be, with evidence enough, concluded from the computation of the dayes of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which are here ſaid to have been fully come [or fulfilled]; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the convention of the Apoſtles, with the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> near adjoyning, in the ſame place, on this day. There are learned and grave Authors, both ancient and modern, who are thus minded, and ſeem to make the proof of the point of no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at all. It gives large credit, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the Opinion, That the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> recordeth that it was the <hi>Lords day</hi> alſo, on which <hi>he was in the Spirit</hi> [that is, with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the praepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:43506:167"/> him with light and glory] preſenting him with thoſe myſterious and prophetical Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, recorded in the book of the <hi>Revelation, Chap.</hi> 1.10. Now (as we argued lately upon a like occaſion), it had been beneath the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſo great an Apoſtle, to make ſuch a treaſure of the circumſtance of time, or of the day of the week, when the Spirit came in that extraordinary manner upon him, as to make ſo particular a record of it, had he not known it to have been a matter of weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to commend it hereby unto <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or a day intended by God to be obſerved by them, and on which he purpoſed to make richer diſcoveries of himſelf, unto thoſe that ſhould now attend on him (as it ſeems <hi>John</hi> in ſpecial manner did) than on other dayes. Much more might be argued (and hath been argued by others) to prove the day of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath exauthorized and diſcharged by God, upon the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And that the day hereof was ſubſtituted by his will and appointment, made known unto his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and by him, unto the Apoſtles; and by them, unto the Churches, in it's ſtead; ſome expreſs themſelves in the point thus, As Chriſt ordain'd the Supper in ſtead of the Paſcal Lamb; ſo hath he appointed the firſt day of the week in place of the laſt.</p>

                        <hi>But how can the Fourth Commandement be termed, Moral, or be numbred amongſt the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:43506:168"/> Commandements, that are ſuch, if the day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required to be kept holy, be of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſuch, to the obſervation whereof men are not perpetually obliged, but only for a time?</hi>

                     <p>The ſervices, or things enjoyned in the Commandement, being <hi>Moral,</hi> and ſuch which are indiſpenſably, and for ever, binding; though applyed by the Commandement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a day, which is in it ſelf alterable upon occaſion; yet may the Commandement, in reſpect thereof, be truly and properly enough called, <hi>Moral;</hi> yea, though the ſaid day be actually, and <hi>de facto,</hi> altered. The command of God requiring of men a ceſſation from bodily labours, and worldly imployments, one day in ſeven, or every ſeventh day, that they may be at liberty, both in body, and mind, to attend upon the worſhip of God, and great concernments of their ſouls, is naturally moral, and expreſſive of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, which is unchangeable; or of one particular ſtrain, or ray of it. Nor is the day nominated and appointed by the Commandement, properly ceremonial, or of like conſideration with other dayes of Feaſtival Solemnities appointed by the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi> Law; becauſe it is not properly, or upon ſuch terms abrogated, as they are, as <hi>viz.</hi> without any other to ſucceed them in their reſpective ſervices, but is only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:43506:168"/> by him, that was, and ſtill is, the Lord of it; having another day of a friendly and rich ſympathy with it, a day of reſt and refreſhing unto God, as it alſo was; only more worthy and honourable, given unto it to ſucceed in it's ſtead. Beſides, neither is the day we ſpeak of, wholly, or in reſpect of every thing found in it, exchanged: it hath ſomewhat of a Moral conſideration; in reſpect of which it may be ſaid ſtill to retain its authority and binding Power, and to exerciſe them in its Succeſſour: For it is not meerly, or ſimply a day, or a ſpace of time containing either 12 or 24 hours, but a <hi>SEVENTH</hi> day, or ſuch a ſpace of time, which never begins, or returns, untill ſix times as much as it ſelf, hath paſſed by and gone before, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues but its own proportion, or period: and ſo gives place again, and waiteth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſix dayes more of equal duration (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively) with it ſelf, be fulfilled, and then returneth of courſe. Now ſuch a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day as this, is an equitable, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable proportion of time, and may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be eſtimated by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For men (ordinarily), yea and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring beaſts alſo, to reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toyl; and for men, upon this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to exerciſe themſelves in duties of Religion, in acquainting themſelves with God, and with the manner of his true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43506:169"/> and ſervice; that knowing theſe things and practiſing accordingly, they may be found meet to be ſaved, and made eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy by him: That this proportion of time, a ſeventh day, is moſt competent for the occaſions and ends now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is not a myſtery or ſecret above the reach of nature, hath been already hinted; and might be ſufficiently proved by many ſayings yet extant in the writings of ſuch men, who have been the ſons of no higher an inſpiration; but that this hath been done, to all reaſonable ſatisfaction, by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that there is ground large enough, on which to judge and conclude the Fourth Commandement to be Moral, although the day therein ſpecified, be exchanged for another.</p>

Now it hath been lately ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and proved, Firſt, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the firſt day of the week (the day of his Reſurrection).

                     <p>That theſe Ten Words were written by God himſelf, in two Tables of ſtone, and this twice over, or at two ſeveral times (the two firſt written, having been broken by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his zealous indignation againſt the Idolatry of the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19.) is evident from the Scriptures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.15, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.22. and 10.1, 2. Onely here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affirmed, either concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or the particulars of the words written in the one Table, or the other. It is moſt like that they were written in the Tables, in that order, wherein they are from place to place rehearſed: Yea, from the two diſtinct
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43506:171"/> Natures, and Relations of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſome of them more particularly, and immediately reſpecting, the deportment of men towards God; others, their deportment towards one another, and every mans towards himſelf, (which diſtinction is taken notice of, and approved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 39. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.29, 30, 31.): It is next to unqueſtionable, that thoſe of the firſt ſort, more directly reſpecting God, were written by themſelves in one, the former of the Tables; and the reſt, in the other. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſignment of the four firſt, unto the firſt Table, and the ſix remaining, unto the latter (which is the diviſion commonly received amongſt us) hath nothing in it (as far as I can judge) that needs offend, or ſcruple any man. For though the fourth Commandment ſeems to be of a mixt nature, and requires of Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that they permit that indulgence, or reſpite from bodily labour, unto their ſervants, and thoſe under their power, which God hath judged meet to be allowed unto them, as well as their own attendance upon the worſhip of God; yet, in as much as that reſt from labour, is impoſed by God upon a Spiritual account, and for Religious ends, the Commandment (I take it) may, without errour, paſs in the retinue of thoſe, that ſtand in ſpecial relation unto God, and ſo be adjudged to the Firſt Table. The Papiſts to accommodate (as it ſeems) their Doctrine and Practice of Image-Worſhip,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43506:171"/> Of the Firſt and Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as we account, and diſtinguiſh) make but one: and becauſe they know themſelves ingaged to find, and acknowledg the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ten, therefore to heal their abſurdity of <hi>Addition,</hi> they apply a greater of <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi> importunely rending, and making two of the Tenth.

                     <p>The juſt ſenſe of the Law, and meaning God in it, is to be gathered and inferred from the writings both of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where the holy Ghoſt hath in ſeveral places, and upon ſeveral occaſions, declared ſometimes one part, or precept of it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another: by the diligent obſerving, and comparing of which together, certain general Directions &amp; Rules, may be framed (as ſeveral have been by learned men, ſtudious and expert in the Scriptures); by the light and guidance
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43506:173"/> of which it may be ſo interpreted and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and this with truth, that the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity of it (in the ſenſe declared) will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appear, and be acknowledged. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, out of the curioſity of their obſervations, have (as they affirm) found in the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> the two affirmative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in the Law (the fourth and the fifth, for all the reſt are negative) multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their explication, into 248.

The obſervations, if true, or near unto truth, are not altogether uſeleſſe.</p>

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:43506:174"/> end (being not repugnant to the end of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as great, or greater then it) is to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon, as commanded therein; ſo on the other hand, whatſoever is contrary to this end, and of a direct tendency to hinder it, is to be reckoned amongſt the things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this Commandement. Now the end (I mean the appropriate end) of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (reſpectively) is not hard to be found out; A little conſideration will diſcover it unto us.</p>

For if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth ſuch, or ſuch a thing to be done, it is plain that he forbiddeth the doing of that which is contrary to it. Again, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth or forbiddeth any thing, it is as plain that his will and meaning is, to have that done which is oppoſite to it. If he commandeth Children to honour their Parents, or inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, their ſuperiours, he doth by the vertue and import of this Command, forbid them to neglect, deſpiſe, or diſhonour them. So when he forbiddeth men to murder, he doth hereby enjoyn them to be careful for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the lives of men, and to uſe all due means, when occaſion requireth, for
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43506:174"/> the maintaining, and ſafe guarding of them: This Rule gives light to the ſenſe and mind of God in all the Commandements.</p>

But to give a little light to the meaning of the rule by an inſtance or two. Where Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is expreſly forbidden (as in the 7th. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement) all aſſaulting of men by force, all intended affrighting them, all wounding or maiming their bodies, the doing of any thing without juſt Cauſe, that is like to cauſe grief, or ſadneſſe of heart, unto any, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the wages, or hires of poor labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men, the detaining of their pledge, if they have occaſion to uſe it for their Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the refuſing to pay monies, when they are due, unto ſuch perſons, who live and ſubſiſt, they with their Families, by the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

The reaſon of this Rule
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:43506:175"/> alſo is not far off. For men being generally indiſpoſed unto vertuous actions, and ſuch which are their duty to do, he that enjoyneth them ſuch actions, muſt be conceived to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join them (as it were) of courſe, the uſe of ſuch means, which are proper and likely to remove that indiſpoſition, and in the ſtead thereof, to introduce, or raiſe an inclination, or willingneſſe in the Soul, unto theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or duties. Yea the neglect of the uſe of means, that are proper to prepare and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie men for the performance of a duty, is in reaſon, a greater ſin, and for the moſt part more burdening the conſcience, yea and more provoking in the ſight of God, then the non-performance of the duty it ſelf.

Thus where the Honouring of Parents, whether naturally and properly ſuch, or ſuch by analogie and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as Magiſtrates, Teachers, Guardians, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is commanded; we are commanded alſo to promote the Intereſt of the ſaid Command, by exhorting and perſwading (as occaſion is offered, and when it ſhall be ſeaſonable) all perſons, both young, and old, to the practice of it; by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, commending, and ſhewing reſpects unto thoſe that are conſcientious in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it; and again, by admoniſhing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, diſcountenancing, thoſe that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers, and tranſgreſſours of it. There is the ſame conſideration of all other duties in their
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43506:178"/> reſpective commands. The reaſon of this Rule proceeds upon the ſame account with the reaſon of the former. God, the Law-giver, intending ſubjection by men, unto all his Laws, and the diligent practiſe of every good work, or duty, commanded by him, muſt in reaſon be conceived to require of men, that they promote and further this ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well in others, as in themſelves, by all good wayes and means upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?</p>

                     <p>Where the duty of an Inferiour towards his Superiour in one particular kind of relation, is required, the like duty (for the nature and kind of it) is required of all Inferiours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſuch their Superiours, who ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto them in any ſuch relation, which holds proportion unto, and is of, alike conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration with that other.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43506:179"/> meet they ſhould exhibit by way of duty unto them, there doth he require the ſame of thoſe towards the other Superiours menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (with the like) who ſtand in the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Inferiours unto them. The reaſon of this Rule, is; becauſe, the ſame duty, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, cannot but well become all ſuch Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which reſemble one the other, and are of a like nature and conſideration, at leaſt as farr as the reſemblance between them doth extend; God likewiſe judging it meet to provide for the compendiouſneſs of his Law, as much as with conveniency might be, and ſo not to multiply Commandements, where one, with a little interpoſure of Reaſon and Conſcience to interpret, would ſerve as well as many.</p>

Thus, where the duty of the Wife towards her Husband is impoſed upon her, the duty of the Husband towards the Wife is conſequentially, and interpretatively, charged upon him likewiſe. So, where the duties of Subjects, of Children, of Servants, of the particular members of a Chriſtian Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they owe unto their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43506:179"/> Superiours, (all comprehended under the word <hi>honour</hi>) are charged by God upon them; the correſponding duties, which theſe Superiours reſpectively owe unto them again, are required by the ſame authority, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like encouragements, and penalties, at their hand. The reaſon of this Rule, is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as that ſaying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is founded upon plain equity, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whomſoever much is given, of him much will be required,</hi> (Luk. 12.48.)

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43506:180"/> their ſuperiors, and again, of ſuperiours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their inferiours, are injoyned; the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of equals towards equals are included, and injoyned alſo. The reaſon of this Rule, is, becauſe the duties of equals towards equals, may, by the light, and impartial debates of Reaſon and Conſcience intervening, be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the nature of the reciprocal duties which mutually intercede between inferiours and ſuperiours. And God (as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hinted) is not wont to multiply Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, when any one of thoſe few, which he hath given, is ſufficient to ſhew Conſcience her work by the help and improvement of her own light. Now the duties between equals, the duties between ſuperiours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours being well known, may be eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or computed, thus. My equal, being in relation unto me, next, or neer unto him that is my ſuperiour on the one hand, and on the other, next, or neer likewiſe unto him that is my inferiour; it is reaſonable and meet that I allow and give unto him, ſomewhat a certain proportion, though leſſe, of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which I owe to my ſuperiours, and alſo a like proportion of that protection, care, moderation, and other duties, which I owe to my inferiours.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43506:180"/> owe unto another man, as a man, or unto my Neighbour, is enjoyned me, here I am charged with the performance of the ſame, or like duties towards my ſelf; only with ſuch exceptions, interpretations, or proviſoes, which the Scriptures themſelves, that are the beſt Expounders of the Law, as well as the common light of Reaſon, inform me, ought to be made in the caſe. Thus, where I am commanded not to wrong my Neighbour, either in his repute, eſtate, relations, limbs, or life, and the like; I ſtand charged not to injure, or prejudice my ſelf in any of theſe. So where I am commanded to love my Neighbour, to be helpfull unto him in his need, to counſel and adviſe him the beſt I can, as well in his ſpiritual as temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to bear his burthens, to cover his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, to uphold his reputation as farre as with truth, and a good Conſcience, I am able, &amp;c. all theſe (with ſeveral others of like nature) I ſtand bound by the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to perform unto my ſelf. Only, as the ſaying is; There is no general Rule without its exceptions; So in the caſe of the Rule before us, there are ſome things of which I am a debtor unto my Neighbour by vertue of the Commandement of God; of which I am not hereby made a debtor unto my ſelf. It is my duty upon occaſion, to give as large a teſtimony unto my Neighbour, and to ſpeak as much good of him, as with truth
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:43506:181"/> and knowledge I can: but it is not proper for me to do the like by my ſelf. So if my Neighbour be <hi>overtaken with a fault,</hi> I ſtand bound in duty to <hi>reſtore</hi> [that is, to endeavour to reſtore] <hi>him, in the ſpirit of meekneſſe,</hi> (Gal. 6.1.): but I am not bound to ſhew the like tenderneſs to my ſelf, in the like caſe. Some other particulars there may be, (though I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they are not many) which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, that oblige me to my Neighbour, do not impoſe upon me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, at leaſt in the letter of them, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe then in a way of proportion, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollency, unto my ſelf. And theſe variations, vvhich are but interpretations of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements (reſpectively) are preſcribed and taught (as was even now hinted) in the Scriptures. But the reaſon of the Rule may be this: All thoſe things, which God judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meet to be performed and done by every man unto other, being in their natures bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and good unto all thoſe, to whom they ought to be, and are, performed, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are performed, and conſequently being ſuch unto every man, though perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto him by himſelf; therefore to ſalve the brevity intended in his Law, he enjoyns every mans duty to himſelf, in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement with his duty to other men.</p>

                     <p>When two Commandements meet in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the one unto the other, ſo that they cannot both be obeyed, the greater ought to have the homage of obedience performed unto it, the binding force of the leſſer ceaſing in ſuch a caſe, ſo that if the greater be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there is no tranſgreſſion of the leſſe. Our Saviour giveth teſtimony to the truth and uſefulneſs of this Rule, in two or three Inſtances. Firſt, where the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, allowing the eating of the Shew-bread unto the Prieſts only, meeting with the Morall Law, which enjoyneth the uſe of means for the preſervation of life, upon ſuch terms, that obedience could not be yielded unto both, gave place unto the latter, and was diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſin in him that did tranſgreſſe it; who (queſtionleſſe) had ſinned, if, as the caſe at preſent ſtood with him, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he had not diſobeyed it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.3, 4. The Moral Law, being the greater, in the juncture of the competition, ſuperſeded the authority of the Ceremonial, as being the leſſe. Again, where the Law injoyning a ſtrict Reſt, or ceſſation from work, on the Sabbath day, as being a law of inferiour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, did not oblige the Prieſts againſt that Law, by which they ſtood charged to worſhip God, by ſlaying, and offering ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Temple, even on that day, this
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43506:182"/> being a Law of more conſiderable and rich import, then the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.5. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance like unto this we find, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.22. The reaſon of this Rule is nothing but what the common light of reaſon ſuggeſteth, <hi>viz.</hi> That in all Competitions between two things of unequal worth and goodneſſe, where both cannot be choſen, or embraced, the more worthy, and weighty in goodneſſe, ought to have the preheminence. By the light of this Rule, evident it is, that the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the firſt Table, which reſpect the glory and intereſt of God, are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in obedience before thoſe of the ſecond, which concern the intereſt of the Creature, when both cannot be obeyed. As, when we cannot but either betray, or deny ſome truth of God which he hath made knovvn to us, and ſo ſin againſt a great duty of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or elſe diſobey the Magiſtrate, Father, Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo expoſe our ſelves to the loſſe of our greateſt comforts in the things of this world, yea it may be of life it ſelf, which are all contrary to the ſenſe of the greateſt duties of the ſecond Table (in ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) in this caſe we muſt obey the charge of the firſt Table, and ſtand by the truth of God with our teſtimony, and diſobey ſuperiours, whatſoever be the conſequence of it. It is true, and the inſtances lately mentioned do confirm it, that the greater duties of the ſecond Table, are, by Gods gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43506:182"/> and allowance, to take place of the letter duties of the firſt Table, when there happeneth a competition between them. But the duties of the ſame degree in both Tables being compared, thoſe of the firſt, being the more important, ought to have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, in Competitions.</p>

                     <p>Affirmative Commands are alwayes bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not binding to be alwayes practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or actually doing, what they command; but only at times convenient, and upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and due occaſions. They are (indeed) binding alwayes, to maintain the habits of thoſe vertuous and worthy actions, which they enjoyn, or an inward diſpoſition or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of mind to be doing the things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them, upon all occaſions. Thus when, and where, I am commanded to call upon God, to meditate of his works, to reverence his Word, &amp;c. I am not commanded to be alwayes imployed in the actual exerciſe of theſe, or any of theſe duties, but only to be alwayes prepared and ready for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them (reſpectively) upon all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: and when opportunity ſerveth, to perform them actually. There is the ſame conſideration of all affirmative Precepts in matters appertaining to the ſecond Table. The Reaſon of this Rule, is, becauſe it is
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43506:183"/> meet that every vertuous and worthy action' as well one as another, ſhould have time and place to be practiſed, and wrought, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God on the one hand, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the world on the other hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it. But evident it is, that this could not be (I mean, orderly, and without ſin) if any Commandement which bindeth to the practiſe of any one of them, ſhould bind them to the continual practice of it; inaſmuch as a man imployed in one action, during ſuch his imployment, is uncapable of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Thus the Commandement by which I ſtand charged not to hate God, not to deſpiſe him, not to make him a lyar, (by not believing him) not to murther, not to commit adultery, &amp;c. impoſeth a charge upon me to refrain from all theſe miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours at all times, and never to be found in any of them. The reaſon of this Rule is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every evil or ſinfull action is alwayes,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43506:183"/> and in every caſe whatſoever, repugnant to the glory of God, and contrary to the true and real intereſt of men.

But as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth and diſpoſeth him to inveigle or intiſe away this Servant from him, it is a ſin againſt the Eighth Commandement.

                     <p>The comelineſſe of theſe actings, by ſuch a creature, as Man is, may be conceived, or eſtimated, thus, or in theſe two particulars. Firſt, that a creature endued with the excellent faculties, of reaſon, underſtanding, &amp;c. ſhould not onely, or ſimply, <hi>give honour, to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belongeth;</hi> but that kind, and degree of honour, which of right appertaineth unto every one. This the light of nature ſheweth to be comely and meet. Secondly, that ſuch
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43506:187"/> a creature, by ways, and means, that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, ſhould conſult it's own honur, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and well-being, and not through folly, expoſe it ſelf to ſhame, and miſery; this alſo is comely for it, in every eye. Now both theſe are evidently found in this creature's chuſing, owning, and honouring, the true God, for his God, and no other beſides. For firſt, it is an honour appropriately due unto this God, to be ſingled out from amongſt all others, that are called Gods in the world, yea, and from amongſt all other Beings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by that creature of his we ſpeak of, and to be owned, and honoured by it, for the God thereof: and it is an horrid and blaſphemous indignity, or affront, put upon Him, either not to be owned, and honoured, by this his creature, as it's God; or that any other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a God (ſo called) or whatſoever is, or can be named otherwiſe, ſhould be taken into fellowſhip with him in this relation, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Again ſecondly, this creature, by chuſing, owning, and honouring the true God for his God, provideth; and this in a way of the moſt ſuper-tranſcendent ſecurity; for his honour, and higheſt degree of well-being. <hi>Happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43506:187"/> with him, he ſhall moſt certainly conſult his own ſhame, ruin, and confuſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27.</p>

                     <p>The expreſſion may import, or hold forth, a great argument, or motive, to perſwade to the obſervance of the Commandement, in one main point of it; as namely, that if any man ſhall <hi>have</hi> any <hi>other God,</hi> one, or more, but, or beſides, himſelf, though he may think to carry it ſecretly enough, yet the abomination will be acted <hi>before his face,</hi> and as it were in his preſence, and whileſt he looketh on. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.20.21. Now as the eye and preſence of the husband, is a potent obligation upon the wife, whilſt ſhe is under them, to refrain all unchaſt behaviour with other men; and ſhe muſt be impudent above women, that will play the adultereſſe before the face of her husband: ſo is it a conſideration very force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and awful, to keep men from going a whoring (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) after any ſtrange God, that they cannot commit this wickedneſſe, but before the face of that God, who onely is their lawful husband, and whoſe name is, <hi>Jealous.</hi>

                        <hi>Why doth God ſo ſtrictly, and with ſuch variety and particularity of expreſſion, by ſuch great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and ingagements, beyond what is found in any other of the Commandements, prohibite all will-worſhip, or falſe-worſhip, [that is, all methods, wayes, geſtures, habits, means of excitement unto devotion, in one kind, or other, which are of Humane device, or contrivance, and made uſe of by men in their worſhipping of him?]</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The chief Reaſons hereof may be theſe two,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe men are exceedingly apt, even impotently inclined, to take ſuch pleaſure in, and ſo to dote upon, their own Inventions, in, and about the worſhip of God, whereby their hearts are withdrawn and taken off, from
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:43506:191"/> that reverence and eſteem, which they owe unto the true worſhip of God, preſcribed by himſelf, and from that delight, which they muſt take herein, if they deſire that God ſhould delight in them, or do any great things for them. Even as the ſenſual contentment and pleaſure, which the Adultereſs taketh in the imbracings of him that committeth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her, alienateth her affection from her lawful husband, unto whom it ought to be conſtant and intire. The reſemblance is very natural, and (as we uſe to ſay of Pictures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately taken) to the life: in which reſpect the Scripture ſo much delighteth to ſet forth the nature of Idolatrous, and falſe Worſhip by it. And beſides, it ſeems to intimate, that God taketh a moſt high and ſacred content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in being truly and purely worſhipped, and in thoſe who thus worſhip him; even as the affectionate husband receiveth marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great ſolace and ſatisfaction in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal imbracings of a wife that is chaſt and loyal (ſee and compare, and diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20.) It is fully comporting with this notion, that in this very Commandement (as oft elſewhere) he declares and ſtyles himſelf, a <hi>Jealous</hi> God. Now then, as where the tide is wont to run, and bear up with greater violence and force, than is uſual in other places, the banks that are made to defend the country and fields adjoyning, from inundations, and breakings in
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:43506:191"/> of waters, had need, both to be raiſed higher, and to be more ſtrongly fortified, then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; ſo it is but reaſonable, that the ſinfull propenſions in the hearts and ſouls of men, which are known unto God to be more erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and likely to break forth upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then others; and when they do break forth, to be of a more pernicious conſequence to the greateſt Intereſt, both of Creatour and Creature alſo; ſhould be reſtrayned by Laws and Commandements contrived and formed, both in words and matter (as it were) on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for ſo great a ſervice, both unto God, and Man, as the preventing of the breakings out of ſuch corruptions muſt needs be. This is one Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God foreſeeing that in after-ages there would from time to time, ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men riſe up in the world, yea and in his Church it ſelf, who would, not only give up themſelves to be acted and led by a ſpirit of ſpiritual whoredoms and fornications, and pollute themſelves over head and ears, with idolatrous, ſuperſtitious, ſelf-deviſed, and men-deviſed Worſhips, in ſeveral kinds; but alſo, with all rigour, as by impriſonments, confiſcation of Goods, excommunications, oppreſſions, and vexations in all kinds, yea and ſometimes by baniſhment, yea and by threatning, and inflicting death it ſelf upon them that would not ſubmit, would attempt the Loyalty of the Sons and Daughters of God
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:43506:192"/> amongſt them, and compel them to drink of the ſame cup of abominations with them: God (I ſay) foreſeeing this, partly to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and allay, if it might be, the ſacrilegious rage of ſuch oppreſſours; but chiefly (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) effectually to antidote the ſouls and conſciences of his children againſt the deadly poyſon of yielding unto, or complying with, ſuch defilements in his Worſhip, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch ſore temptations to commit this folly, and hereby to cauſe a breach between their God and their ſouls, was graciouſly pleaſed to fortifie his Commandement againſt foraign and falſe worſhips, at an higher rate, then he had done any of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſides. Other reaſons might be given: but theſe two, at preſent, may ſuffice.</p>

In like manner, all ſuch actings, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our ſelves, whereby it appears that we are affraid of Gods diſpleaſure, either for the omitting, or not doing, of what he no wayes requires of us; or elſe for the doing of that, which is our duty to do.

                        <hi>What are the Duties more particularly required in this Commandement? or ſome of the principal of them? (For, according to the ſecond Rule, every negative Commandement includeth his affirmative oppoſite to it.)</hi>

                     <p>The general Duty here required is, that at times convenient, and as oft as any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or opportunity inviteth us, we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the true God purely, according to his will; that is, in ſuch a way onely, in, and by ſuch outward means, and with ſuch rites, as himſelf hath taught, and preſcribed in his Word.

                        <hi>How, or in what ſenſe, doth God threaten, that he will</hi> viſite the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third, and fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, of them that hate him?</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, God doth not threaten to <hi>viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children,</hi> &amp;c. but onely when he finds them in the Children, as well as he did in the Fathers. This he plainly declareth in thoſe words, <hi>of them that hate me:</hi> which are reſtrictive, and interpretative, of the preceeding threatning; and imply, that unleſſe the <hi>Children,</hi> in their reſpective Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations ſhall <hi>hate</hi> him, [that is, the cauſe being put for the effect, (a frequent dialect in Scriptures) ſhall ſin againſt him, as their Fathers did] he intends not the Threatning againſt them. See for this <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.14. &amp;c. Secondly, the reaſon why God doth not ſay, that he will viſit the <hi>Childrens</hi> own ſins upon them, but the ſins of their <hi>Fathers;</hi> nor again, that he will viſit the ſins of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon themſelves, but upon their <hi>Children;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof (I ſay) may be, becauſe God judgeth it meet, many times not to puniſh in this world, [with any exemplary puniſhment, or judgement, which kind of puniſhment he
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43506:194"/> meaneth by the word <hi>viſit</hi>] the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors in a Family, or race, but rather pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to await the triall and proof of their Poſterity, (to <hi>the third and fourth generation;</hi>) and accordingly as theſe ſhall be found, either to repent of, and turn from their Fathers ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, unto God, or to go on, and continue in the ſame, or like courſe of provocation; ſo either to ſhew them mercy, and bleſſe them, their Fathers ſins notwithſtanding; or elſe to fall heavy upon them, with ſome ſignal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other; as filling up the meaſure of their Fathers ſins, (which it ſeems, was but half full before; and ſo not as yet, according to the eſtimate of divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>enity, and patience, ready for judgement); and redoubling their provocations. So that God, when he threatens to <hi>viſit the ſins of the Fathers, upon</hi> wicked <hi>Children,</hi> not their own ſins, or wickedneſſe, ſignifieth, or implieth, that, had theſe <hi>Children</hi> been the firſt of their race, that had been wicked, and not been the <hi>Children</hi> of wicked <hi>Parents;</hi> although their wickedneſſe had been the ſame, or as great as now it is, they ſhould, or might have eſcaped the <hi>viſitation</hi> here threatned (for I ſuppoſe that God by this tnreatning, <hi>I will viſit the ſins of the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. doth not imply, that he will never, or in no caſe, <hi>viſit</hi> [with temporal judgements] the ſins of the Fathers, upon themſelves, as well as upon their Children, (being wicked alſo); the current of the Scriptures will ill bear ſuch
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:43506:195"/> a ſenſe as this: but only declareth, that when and though he doth ſuffer wicked Parents to go unpuniſhed, yet their Children, if they follow them in their wickedneſſe, ſhall be ſure to hear from him in wrath and judgment, and that becauſe they are the Children of ſuch Parents, as well as becauſe they are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves). Hence it is, that when God threatneth the <hi>Jews</hi> with any ſeverity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their wickedneſſe, we ſo frequently meet with the mention of the Fathers iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (though now dead) as well as the Childrens who are the perſons threatened in this, or the like form of words, <hi>you and your Fathers,</hi> Jer. 44.21. So <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was charged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the people, that <hi>they, and their Fathers, had tranſgreſſed</hi> [or rebelled] <hi>againſt him,</hi> when he was ſent by God to denounce judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3,2. And ſo holy men very frequently in their confeſſions, knowing it to be their duty to juſtifie God in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whether already inflicted, or only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the cleareſt and fulleſt manner they could, upon this account confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as well the ſins of their Fathers as their own. <hi>For our ſins</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi>) <hi>and for the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of our FATHERS, Jeruſalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, Dan.</hi> 9.16.

Yea and God himſelf in pleading the equity of his proceeding in judgment againſt men, is wont to alledge and inſiſt upon the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Fathers as well as of the Children, threatned, or puniſhed by him, <hi>Then ſhalt thou ſay unto them, Becauſe your FATHERS have forſaken me,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>May there any reaſon be conceived, why God ſhould ordinarily, or (at leaſt) very frequently,</hi> viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children <hi>(in ſuch a ſenſe, and upon ſuch tearms, as you have now declared) rather then upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi>

                     <p>There may more reaſons then one be well apprehended of this diſpenſation of God. But I ſhall inſiſt only upon one, which I conceive to be one of the moſt conſiderable. This is, that when he doth uſe ſeverity in judging and puniſhing his Creature, it may appear that his Creature is not ſimply or barely obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto puniſhment, that is, not only ſo farr ſinful or delinquent to ſuch a degree, that he may juſtly puniſh him, but that he is (in

Neither doth God judge it ſufficient for the glory of his Righteouſneſſe, or Juſtice, in his penall Adminiſtrations, that he may be <hi>juſtified</hi> in them [as <hi>viz.</hi> by ſome exquiſite or profound Argument, or Plea, made on his behalf] but that he may be clear when he judgeth; that is, that the equitie and reaſonableneſſe of his judgments may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear out of hand, and by their own light, and as the Sun appeareth unto the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3,4. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſeveral places, and in ſeveral veins of notion, preſenteth God under this Character <hi>viz.</hi> as liſtleſſe and indiſpoſed, and (as it were) without heart to puniſh [in any degree of ſeverity] untill the wickedneſſe of men be grown to ſome conſiderable maturity, and height. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Where he compares the degree, or proportion of ſin, wherher in a perſon, or people, before which he uſually forbeareth to deſtroy, or inflict any ſevere puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, unto a <hi>meaſure,</hi> which muſt be <hi>full,</hi> before he can lift up his hand againſt them in ſuch away. Thus the reaſon which he gives unto <hi>Abraham</hi> his Friend, why he would not preſently ſettle him, or his poſterity in the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:43506:196"/> poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was, becauſe the ſin of the <hi>Amorites</hi> (who were the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inhabitants of this Land, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations) <hi>was not yet F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LL, Gen.</hi> 15.16.

                     <p>Secondly, Where he ſignifieth, or imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he muſt find men unexcuſable in the way of their ſinning, before he enters into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtrict judgment with them, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. &amp; 2, 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now many gracious vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafements from God unto ſinful men, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to render them <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> amongſt vvhich the riches of his <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Thirdly?

This is of ſome affinity with the former, See <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12, 13. So then this may well be a reaſon, why God many times deferreth the viſitation, or ſevere puniſhment of the ſins of Fathers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he finds the Children, to the third and fourth Generation, walking in the ſame or like way of iniquity with them. The patience of God ſhewed unto wicked Parents, rendreth their Children, if they prove wicked alſo, much more obnoxious unto the judgment of God.</p>

                        <hi>What may be the reaſon, why God extendeth his Threatning of</hi> viſiting the ſins of the Fathers

                        <hi>Why doth God, in this Commandement, rather then in any of the reſt, threaten to</hi> viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children?</p>

                     <p>Becauſe Children and poſterity, are not in ſo much danger of being wicked, or of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking God upon their Fathers account, or
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:43506:198"/> by imitating and following them, in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of wickedneſſe, as in the way of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and ſuperſtitious worſhip of God: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the Fathers have had peace, and proſpered in the world, in the way of this ſin, and the Children been partakers with them in theſe things. A lightſome Inſtance hereof we have in the conteſt of the people with the Prophet, Jer. 44.17. <hi>But we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incenſe unto the Queen of Heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our Fathers, our Kings and our Princes, in the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and ſaw no Evill. But ſince, &amp;c.</hi> And that Children (generally) are more apt to inherit (and commonly do inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) the ſuperſtitious and idolatrous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and practiſes of their Fathers and fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rather then any other of their ſins, (not relating unto theſe); as well the Scriptures, as our own obſervation of the courſe of the world in this behalf, may ſufficiently inform us: <hi>Hath any nation</hi> (ſaith God himſelf) <hi>changed their Gods, wich yet are no Gods?</hi> Jer. 2.11. See 2 Kin. 17.28, 29. &amp; 30, 34. &amp; ver. 41. Thus: <hi>So theſe Nations feared the Lord, and ſerved their Graven Images, both their Children and their Childrens Children: as did their Fathers, ſo did they to this day.</hi> For brevity ſake, I omit many other places, pregnant with confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:43506:198"/> of the point in hand; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20, 24, 30. <hi>Amos.</hi> 2.4.2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Why ſhould Children be more prone to imitate and follow their Parents in waies of Superſtitions and Idolatry, then of other ſins?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One reaſon hereof may be, becauſe though theſe be very horrid, and highly-provoking ſins, yet have they an appearance and ſhew of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> (<hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.3.) and devout affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards God, which no other ſin hath. We know, how plauſibly and confidently, the Doctors of the Romiſh perſwaſion plead the cauſe of their Superſtitions, and Idolatrous worſhip. Another (in conjunction with this) may be, that Children, for the moſt part, are naturally inclined to think honourably and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently of their Parents, eſpecially in things appertaining unto God, and to Salvation: and in this reſpect have a natural averſneſſe to diſparage their Religion, by rejecting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing it for another; and by ſuch a practiſe or means, as this to ſeem, jealous or doubtful (at leaſt) leſt they dyed under the diſpleaſure of God, and ſo are curſed eternally. And becauſe there is ordinarily, ſuch a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in Children to own, and cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that manner and way of vvorſhipping God, wherein their Fathers and Fore-fathers went before them, hence (I conceive) it is that God, in the Scriptures, makes it an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:43506:199"/> of the ſin of ſuch Children, whoſe Fathers were true Worſhippers of the true God, when they turn aſide into waies of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, that they worſhip gods, whom neither they <hi>nor their FATHERS have known.</hi> Jer. 19.4. Deut. 13.6. &amp; 32.17. and ſo likewiſe that he ſtiles Idolatrous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Nations, the Parents or the Fathers and Mothers, of thoſe who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in their worſhip and Religion: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto Jeruſalem, Thy birth, and thy Nativity is of the Land of Canaan, thy FATHER was an</hi> Amorite, <hi>and thy MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER an</hi> Hittite [meaning that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> complyed with theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their Religion, ſuch as it was, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, as if they had been their natural Parents] <hi>Ezek</hi> 16.3. Thirdly, out of that Hope, and perſvvaſion, which are very incident to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and poſterity, That it is well with the ſouls of their Parents, and Fore-fathers, in the ſtate of death, they are inclinable, yea and deſirous, (though at ſome peradventure) to be with them, when they dye, and to fare as they fare. And conceiving that the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and way of worſhipping and ſerving God, is a likely means to bring them into the ſame condition with them after death, hence they reſolve to profeſſe and practiſe none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fourthly, (and laſtly) that which is as conſiderable, as any of the former, Perſons given up to Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:43506:199"/> are more generally if not univerſally, given up likewiſe unto ſome other kind, one or more, of ſin and wickedneſſe beſides. We need not appeal to the Authority of Scripture-record for the confirmation of this (though here be plenty of it to be found), that part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, which have made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of worſhipping the true God purely, and without the pollutions of fleſh-deviſed worſhip, for ſeverall hundreds of years laſt paſt, have given a loud teſtimony unto the truth hereof in one particular, the crying ſin of Cruelty wiith the bloud and heavy oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of many of them; and beſides, have all along known enough, and at this day know, of the vitious and wicked practiſes of thoſe, who have turned aſide unto their own-Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and ſuperſtitious inventions in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. Now perſons, ſuperſtitiouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, being conſcious to themſelves of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foul ſins, which they know to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God, when through the patience of God they eſcape puniſhment for them, and live on peaceably and proſperouſly in the world, they are apt and wont to aſcribe no leſſe then a kind of mediatorie and attoneing vertue unto their ſuperſtitious obſervances, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their proſperity and freedome from puniſhment under the commiſſion of ſo many ſins, unto theſe; as if God had as high an eſteem of them, as themſelves. This alſo might be evinced as a truth unqueſtionable
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:43506:200"/> from the Scriptures (I mean, that will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers and perſons devoted to Apocryphal rites and ordinances in the ſervice of God, are high in confidence, that for their ſakes, they come off with God upon the better terms for ther ſins) but that it would occaſion more prolixity then is needful. Yea, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly probable (and a tough branch it is of the tree of my perſwaſions) that ſuch an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, being, by Satans ſubtile motion, taken into the ſociety, and made one of the thoughts and apprehenſions of men, makes the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world ſo impotently, yea fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, devoted to ſuperſtitious devices of all kinds, as it is known to be at this day. No marvel then if the children of Idolatrous and Superſtitious Parents, being ſeaſoned in their youth vvith ſuch a principle as this, be even precipitately diſpoſed and inclined to walk after their manner in worſhipping and ſerving God, Who would not deſire to be of ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by means of the profeſſion and practiſe whereof he may gratifie his fleſh with what pleaſures of ſin he pleaſeth, without danger of being judged by God for it?</p>

                        <hi>Why doth God in this Commandement, rather then in any other, inſiſt upon his</hi> Jealouſie, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf to be a</hi> Jealous <hi>God, to deterr men from the breach of it?</hi> For, I the Lord thy God, am a Jealous God, viſiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon may be, becauſe his worſhip is the mariage-bed, wherein, he claiming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the only lawful husband (in the notion of a ſpiritual or myſtical mariage) of his creature, deſires to ſolace himſelf with this his Creature-Wife, offering himſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be injoyed by her with like ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contentment. And (doubtleſs) when God is chaſtly, and purely, and affectionately worſhipped by his Creature, the greeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is mutually pleaſing and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in a very high degree: the richeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment which the moſt paſſionate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared yoke-fellows in this world can take in the mutual enjoyments each of other, is but a ſhaddow, a cold and heartleſſe kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of it. Now then God, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious unto himſelf of the ardent love, the dear and tender affections which he beareth unto his Creature (in reſpect of this mariage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> relation) and of his moſt bountiful and royalll intentions towards It, as his wife, when he ſhall for a while have made tryal of her love and loyalty, and withall that he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with, and ſeveral wayes made known unto her, all this, He cannot but be very impatient, and full of indignation, that his beloved Wife ſhould, under ſuch great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements as theſe, pollute the mariage-bed, and play the Adultereſſe in his worſhip, by corrupting her ſelf with ſtrange Ordinances
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:43506:201"/> (that never came out of his heart or ſoul) therein; yea, or ſhould but wantonly dally with frivolous and impertinent Rites or Ceremonies, though ſhe ſhould retain and practiſe ſomewhat of his true worſhip with them. (For <hi>jealouſie</hi> in an Husband (we know) is not only provoked with the groſſe and compleat act of Adultery in his wife, when it comes to his knowledge; but alſo with all leight and looſe behaviour, whether in words, looks, or geſtures, which may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably occaſion any ſuſpicion that way) And the more the heart and ſoul of a man is drawn out unto the wife of his boſome, in love and dearneſſe of affection, and the more kindly he hath expreſſed himſelf unto her from time to time, with ſo much the greater rage is his jealouſie like to break out againſt her, if he ſhall at any time come to underſtand that ſhe hath been diſloyal unto him: which yet, becauſe of his preſent affections unto her, and out of a deſire that himſelf may alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſure and contentment, and ſhe the benefit and ſolace of them, he endeavours, by the beſt means he knoweth, to prevent. And (queſtionleſſe) God, in this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning his worſhip, remindeth his Creature (man) of his nature of <hi>Jealouſie.</hi> not ſo much with an intent to gain the more equitable plea, in caſe his creature ſhall at any time provoke him to expreſſe himſelf in the great ſeverity of it (this, at moſt, is but
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:43506:201"/> his ſecond arie intention in the caſe) as to prevent and cut off all occaſion from himſelf of ever exerciſing it to his creatures prejudice; yet this not ſo much by terrifying the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the ſound, or mention of it, as by diſſwading, or taking it off, in a rational way, from whatſoever is likely to provoke, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, him to ſuch an exerciſe. For as he that <hi>doth good</hi> [and is reſolved to continue ſo to do] hath no cauſe to <hi>fear the Power,</hi> though he <hi>beareth the ſword,</hi> and this <hi>not in vain</hi> (Rom. 13.3, 4.) but hath reaſon, or cauſe in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, to refrain from evill, and to do ſtill that which is good, becauſe of this <hi>ſword:</hi> in like manner men have the greateſt and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt reaſon in the world, becauſe of the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of God, to keep themſelves chaſt and pure in his Worſhip; but whileſt they do this, and with their whole heart are purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and reſolved to do none other, they have no reaſon at all to be terrified with it. But (certainly) the nature of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribeth it [<hi>For jealouſie is the rage of a man, therefore he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance: He will not regard my ranſome, neither will he reſt content, though thou giveſt many gifts,</hi> Prov 6.34, 35.] and the <hi>jealouſie</hi> of God eſtimated by this deſcription, with it's reaſonable allowance for the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the <hi>power</hi> of God<hi>'s wrath</hi> above the <hi>rage</hi> of man, it will be found the moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing under Heaven, and at a moſt
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:43506:202"/> deſperate defiance with all principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence, for a man to ſtain the honor of the mariage-bed of his Creator (I mean, his Worſhip) by imbaſeing it wirh any thing of a meaner original, then Divine. That the worſhip of God preſcribed by himſelf, is notioned in the Scriptures as the mariage-bed, into which he invites his Creature, with an intent to communicate himſelf in ſecret as an Husband unto it, might be demonſtrated from all thoſe places (which are exceeding many) wherein the pollutions of his worſhip with humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, are ſet forth by the Metaphors of Adultery, Whoredome, Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe from ſome others beſides theſe. But I judge it not ſo neceſſary, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or inference, being near enough at hand to be deſcried by a little conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and beſides, ſomewhat hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken to ſuch a purpoſe in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the 48.

Thoſe words of the Spouſe, or Church, to <hi>Chriſt</hi> (there pointed to) <hi>Alſo our bed is green</hi> (Cant. 1.16.) are meant (according to Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> who is the beſt Expoſitor of this Myſtical piece of Scripture, that I have yet ſeen) of the Temple purged, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Divine Worſhip reſtored to their native purity, by the Religious King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in the 18. year of his Reign, whereof we read, 2 King. 23. &amp; Chr. 3.4.</p>

                        <hi>Why ſhould the bringing in, or uſing, of any foraign Ceremony, or Rite of Humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contrivance, be looked upon by God, as adulterating and corrupting his worſhip, and hereupon provoke his Jealouſie, eſpecially when the worſhip preſcribed by himſelf, is performed, and exhibited unto him alſo?</hi>

                     <p>Becauſe it is the ſoveraign priviledge, and prerogative of God, as well to nominate, appoint, and enjoyn his own worſhip, as to be worſhipped with it. This is clear, both in the Scriptures, and in Reaſon. <hi>And they have built the high place of Topheth — to burn their ſons and daughters in the fire, WHICH I COMMANDED THEM NOT, neither came it into my heart,</hi> (Jer. 7.31.) The vvickedneſſe of their Act, who deviſed this new kind of worſhip, or devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not here eſtimated, either by the unnaturalneſſe or barbarous Cruelty of it, nor yet by their intendment of it unto the honour of the Idol <hi>Moloch,</hi> but only by this, that God commanded it not: which plainly implyeth, that it is an uſurpation, upon, or of, his Prerogative: when men ſet up any worſhip, or any piece or appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of worſhip, without his Command, and that for want of the impreſſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution upon it, it is highly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ſight of God, how ſpecious or
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:43506:203"/> pretenſible ſoever it may be otherwiſe, or with men. See further upon this account, <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.3. From theſe words, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27.5.) <hi>And there ſhalt thou build an Altar unto the Lord thy God, an Altar of ſtones: thou ſhalt not lift up any Iron tool upon them;</hi> it is of ready obſervation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That men have itching deſires to be beautifying and adorning the worſhip of God with their additional and artificial devices, judging it too ſimple, plain, and homely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſhall put decency and comlineſſe upon it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God notwithſtanding doth not any whit more allow men to <hi>put to,</hi> then to take from, that which he hath ordered and directed in this kind; according to that ſtrict charge delivered once and again unto men, in the Law: <hi>Ye ſhall not ADD unto the word which I, command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it: that you may keep the Commandements of the Lord your God, which I command you:</hi> (Deut. 4.2. Deut. 12.32. Joſh. 1.7. Prov. 30.6.) In this laſt place the words are: <hi>Add thou not unto his word, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lyar,</hi> [in that thou promiſed'ſt unto thy ſelf, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and favour from God, as doing him worthy ſervice in compleating his Word with thy Supplements, when as thou meeteſt with nothing from him but diſpleaſure, in a
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:43506:203"/> penall reproof, for ſuch thy preſumption. In Scripture, that which deceiveth, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth a man, whether it be a perſon, or thing, is frequently termed, a <hi>Lie:</hi> and he that deceiveth himſelf with vain hopes or expectations, which are a kind of promiſes made unto a mans ſelf, may be termed a <hi>Lyar;</hi> as well as he that promiſeth unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and diſappointeth him. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3. according to the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.45. See this noted in ther margent of the larger Bibles of the laſt Tranſlation]. You may, unto the former texts, add <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. and apply it to the matter in hand, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.14. Now, to add unto the worſhip of God, is the ſame thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (if it be not a degree above it in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and preſumption) with making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions unto his Word: As it is a greater crime in a woman to admit of dalliance with another man, then to report her husbands ſayings with ſome addition of words of her own.</p>
                     <p>From hence it appeareth, how inſufficient and weak a plea it is to juſtifie the plowing with an Oxe and an Aſſe together in the field of Gods Worſhip (I mean, the making up of a ſervice, or worſhip of God, of divine and humane prefcriptions, blended and intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one with the other) that ſuch rites and ceremonies, which are decent, may be allowed in the worſhip of God, not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:43506:204"/> by him, although they call men their Fathers. For from what hath been now argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Scriptures, it is fully evident, that as God by ſaying <hi>Thou ſhalt not Commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> hath reſtained men from the carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the women in the world, every mans lawful Wife only excepted; although he hath named none of them, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them be very fair, and comely: ſo hath he excluded from part and fellowſhip in his worſhip, all ceremonies whatſoever of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aign invention, without naming them, how decent or comely ſoever any of them may ſeem in the eies of men. For otherwiſe, to call any ceremony in the worſhip of God <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> being of a Creature extraction, is that grand abſurdity, which Logicians call, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictio in adjuncto,</hi> as if a man ſhould talke of cold fire, or dry water. The moſt tatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red patch, ript off a beggers coat, and ſtitched upon a new cloke of the moſt Orient Scarlet and richeſt trimming otherwiſe in the moſt viſible place of it, would every whit as well become this rich Garment, as the moſt plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and beſt conditioned ceremony that ever was born of fleſh and bloud in the worſhip of God. There is no man more deſirous of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the worſhip and ſervice of God in his Church, yea of ſuch an uniformity which I conceive to be moſt, yea (rather) only fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, than I. For I preſume there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that owneth the name of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:43506:204"/> is willing and free to ſubſcribe, and practiſe, that worſhip in all points, which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or believeth, to be preſcribed by God himſelf. They are the grand enemies to the Uniformity we ſpeak of, who obtrude upon the Conſciences, either of weak and tender, or of ſtrong and underſtanding <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſuch ceremonies, &amp; formalities in the worſhip and ſervice of God, which being heterogeneal and apocryphal, are ſo conditioned, that they are not in reaſon like to yield any better fruit, then thoſe <hi>fooliſh and unlearned queſtions,</hi> as, the Apoſtle calls them, which (he ſaith) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender ſtrifes,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.23.</p>
                     <p>And as God in the Scriptures from place to place, claimeth it as his appropriate preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to order and preſcribe his own worſhip, not allowing any Creature, part or fellowſhip with him herein; ſo doth reaſon it ſelf inveſt him with it accordingly. For to make it any waies meet, or (indeed) tolerable, for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have the leaſt of his fingers in amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, improving, or advancing the worſhip of God appointed by himſelf by any additional ſupplement thereunto of his own deviſing, this horrid ſuppoſition muſt be made, and ſubſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> that God either knoweth nor what is good and meet for himſelf, or that he is neglective of his own good, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be provided for, in the concernments of his Glory, by the good will and wiſdome of men, then by his own.</p>

                     <p>So then, it being the prerogative of God, claimed, and appropriated unto him, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and adjudged unto him by the clear light of Reaſon it ſelf, to be the ſole founder and diſpoſer of his own worſhip, how can he look upon any thing of Creature-contrivance pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed herein, as a member, or part of it, but with an eye of provoked jealouſie, and as a blaſphemous pollution of his worſhip, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent (indeed) to the ſetting up and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping another God, or Gods with him? For it being acknowledged a branch of divine ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, to appoint divine worſhip, he that in the performance of this Worſhip ſhall allow, or practiſe, any thing, as ſomewhat, or as a part of it, which is deviſed by a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth by this practiſe, or allowance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title ſuch a creature to Divine Honour, and maketh it equal with God. Therefore in all will-worſhip there is Idolatry committed, yea and ſuch Idolatry, which, though it may be thought too hard a cenſure, to call palpable, or groſſe, yet will the practiſe of it (and how much more, the firſt excogitation of it? and how much more then this, all forcible compulſion unto it?) render men, (endued with reaſon and underſtanding (as it were) on purpoſe to inable them to <hi>judge righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and this, where <hi>appearance</hi> tempteth them to judge otherwiſe) extreamly obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to the ſevere jealouſie and judgment of God.</p>

For they, out of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided conſcience about the mind of God in his Commandement of their Sabbath, in ſome rigid (yea and in ſome very ridiculous) obſervances and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes over-acted his mind herein; whereas out of the ſame principle, or a worſe, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted other things of more weight required of them by God in that his Command. But further to the Queſtion you laſt propoſed, I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing thus: If by rigor, and ſtrictneſſe of obſervance, you mean, in general, a ſtrict obſervance of, or obedience unto, the mind and will of God in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as now it is upon a new account (as hath been ſhewed formerly) commended unto us by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles; it ought (doubtleſs) to be obſerved by us with the ſame rigor and ſtrictneſſe, with which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtood bound to the obſervation of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:43506:209"/> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not to grant diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto men to neglect, or omit, the leaſt <hi>iota,</hi> or title, of the will of God concerning them, but rather, on the contrary to inable, quicken, and engage them unto a richer, and more compleat conformity hereunto, then was expected from men before his coming, by reaſon of their want of thoſe large helps, aſſiſtances, and advantages, for that purpoſe, which he brought with him into the world, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 8, 7.8,9, 10). Indeed being a Prieſt of a new Order, he came to make, and made an alteration, or change, in, or of, the Law, (as the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11, 12.) For inſtead of a numerous retinue of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and burthenſome ceremonies, which he hath taken away from the Law, he hath, by h s authority and command, ſubſtituted an increaſe of the fruits of Love, and of mutual ſervices, one unto another. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If by rigor, and ſtrictneſſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, you mean, a ſtrict obſervance of the ſame things in particular, whether actions, or forbearances, which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtood bound to obſerve in their keeping of their Sabbath, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not bound to obſerve their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or day of reſt, with the ſame rigor, or ſtrictneſſe. Yea it ſeemeth, that for ſome ſpace of time (and how long, is uncertain) before <hi>Chriſt</hi> had <hi>nailed unto hiſ Croſſe the hand-writing of ordinances, that was againſt us</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:43506:210"/> 14.) God had remitted ſomewhat of that ſtrictneſſe, which at firſt he required of the <hi>Jews</hi> about the obſervation of their Sabbath. For at firſt it was ſaid unto them, <hi>ye ſhall kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath Day:</hi> and again, <hi>whoſoever doth worf therein, ſhall be put to death, Exod.</hi> 35.2, 3. Yet before the time ſpecified, they, yea the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> made invitations and feaſts on this day, which could not (light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) be performed, without both kindling fires and work done (by ſome, or other). And yet were they herein blameleſſe. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accepted an invitation to one of their Feaſts, and was preſent at it with other gueſts, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 14.1.3.7.) neither was the making of this feaſt, any work either of neceſſity, or of mercy, or relating to the worſhip of God (as is evident) neither was his work, who on the Sabbath day at the command of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> took up his bed, and carryed it (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8, 9.) properly a work of any of theſe Characters. Their Sabbath daies journey, of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof unto them, no man, I ſuppoſe, ever made ſcruple, is ſomewhat of the ſame conſideration. Of the inlargement of their liberty as to theſe and the like particulars, in procedure of time after a more ſtrict impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition upon them at the firſt, a fair account might be given, but that my deſign of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is againſt it. So that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves in after-times, did not obſerve their Sabbath,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:43506:210"/> nor (as it ſeems) ſtood bound to obſerve it, with like ſtrictneſſe, in reſpect of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars (and who knowes in reſpect of how many) unto which they were bound about the time of the firſt delivery of the Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto them, and this by Gods own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his Law. Nor is it an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make it out clearly from the Scriptures with what either ſtrictneſſe, or liberty from things burthenſome and grievous, they ſtood at any time bound to obſerve it. It ſeems they were not at any time bound to obſerve it upon any ſuch termes of ſtrictneſſe, but that they ought, and (doubtleſſe) might well, call it a <hi>delight,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13.) Yea God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf numbreth it amongſt their feaſts, and with the ſame breath (as it were) threatneth to cauſe their mirth, and their <hi>Sabbaths</hi> to ceaſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.11.

As likewiſe in
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:43506:211"/> caſes of a religious import, they might, yea in all caſes of the former conſideration, and in many of the latter, were bound thus to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and work.</p>

For to ſay, that this was further required of them, that in the vening or cloſe of their Sabbath, they were to gather up by Repentance, what they had ſcattered in the day by forgetfulneſſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmities of the fleſh, and humbly to crave of God in Prayer the forgiveneſſe of the iniquity of their holy things, and to bleſſe him with thanksgiving for his holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the like, amounteth to no more (upon the matter) then to ſay, they were bound on that day to do that which they ſtood bound to do every day beſides, not to add, that to bleſſe and praiſe God, yea and to pray unto God for things needful, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and eſpecially for forgiveneſſe of ſins, upon thoſe terms of a gracious audience and acceptance, on which the <hi>Jews</hi> might do both, are ſo farr from deſerving the name of things ſtrict, or rigid, that <hi>David</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood their nature, and propriety of working, pronounceth them <hi>pleaſant</hi> and

If then their Sabbaths, notwithſtanding any ſeeming ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or rigor of thoſe injunctions, unto which they were tyed to ſubmit in the keeping of them, were yet a <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>dayes of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mirth</hi> (as we herd) unto thoſe that loved and feared God amongſt them: how much more ſhould good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under the Goſpel, rejoice in keeping holy their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the Ordinances and ſervices whereof have more marrow and fatneſſe, much more heavenly ſweetneſſe in them, then theirs had, the external obſervation of them in the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:43506:212"/> mean time, being no whit more charged with any thing grievous, or burthenſome to the fleſh, but rather much eaſed, and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated unto their comfort, if not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yet by the farr richer, and more gracious ſupplies of the Spirit; which alſo they may obtain to what meaſure they ſhall deſire, if they ſhall ſtirre up themſelves to ask them of God accordingly?</p>

                     <p>Firſt, in this Commandement, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to remember in the ſix daies preceding that their Sabbath, or day of holy reſt, is drawing near, and will be with them in the courſe of it: and that they be accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and carefull ſo to diſpatch, contrive, and ſettle their worldly buſineſſe within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of theſe daies, that if it be poſſible, no temptation from hence may lye upon them to violate the reſt of their holy day, when it cometh. Next, in the morning of this day, being come, to ſanctifie and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the regular obſerving it, as well in reſpect of inward as outward requirements, by a ſerious and effectual meditation of the high concernments (for their well-being, both in this life and in that which is to come) of a

Then, by prayer as time and opportunity will permit or otherwiſe by ſhort and fervent ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to put themſelves into the beſt capacity they can, for a fruitful attendance upon the ordinances of the publique worſhip of God, and to repair unto them accordingly in due time, and in the injoyment of them to behave themſelves with an exemplary reverence, and fear: and if they have Children (capable of inſtruction) or ſervants under them, to uſe all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> wiſdome, with gentleneſſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to bring theſe unto the love and liking of the ſame practiſes with them in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous keeping of ſuch daies; and withall to be render and careful that they do not make the worſhip and ſervice of God weariſome, or burthenſome unto them (before they know what it means) by any importune urging, preſſing, or compelling them to religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beyond their ſtrength, and what they are well able to bear, or to perform; which may ſoon be worſe and more grievous unto them, then to be held to their ordinary labours; and ſo without taſting any ſpiritual benefit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God by the obſervation of this day, they ſhall be in effect deprived alſo of that corporal benefit, of eaſe and refreſhing, which was in ſpecial manner deſigned by him unto
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:43506:213"/> ſuch as theſe, in his appointment of ſuch a day. Beſides the duties mentioned, we are further required in the Commandement, to exerciſe our ſelves in works of mercy, as God mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth occaſion, and affordeth means, as in viſiting the ſick, in relieving the poor, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling thoſe that are in ſtraights, in comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the abject, and thoſe that are afflicted in mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So to perform works of neceſſity with heavenly minds, and in other caſes both to forbear our ſelves all bodily labour, and works of our particular callings, as likewiſe to imploy our Children, Servants, or others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any buſineſſe of this world; to reject or ſuppreſſe all ſecret thoughts and motions of a worldly, or ſinful import; to refrain all leight and uncomely behaviour, all recreations, which are either unlawful, or ſcandalous, all diſcourſings about worldly affairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and generally whatſoeuer is repugnant to our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in faith and holineſſe, which is the great end of the Commandement.</p>

Yet it is proper enough to the firſt table to require labour or work, in a relative conſideration, as namely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obſervation of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereof (reſpectively). And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is labour, and working in the <hi>ſix daies,</hi> required in this fourth Commandement; <hi>viz.</hi>

Now God commanding us to <hi>labour</hi> the <hi>ſix daies, &amp;c.</hi> with no other intent, or for none other end, then that being free from worldly cares and diſtractions, when the day of his holy reſt commeth, we might be in the better frame and compoſure of mind to yield obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in the due obſervance of it, it may with comfort, yea with confidence, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him, that when in obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him otherwiſe, we ſhall forbear working on any of the ſix daies, he will ſo interpoſe with his good providence on our behalf, that we ſhall ſuffer no ſuch prejudice thereby in our worldly affairs, but ſhall be in as good (or rather in a better) condition to obſerve the day of reſt as without ſuch a forbearance we were like to have been. About the time when the Law of the former Sabbath was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> there were many feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſolemnities, within the Circuit of the year, enjoined by God, and to be obſerved as well on any of the ſix daies, as on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, as often as the daies of the month, unto which they were fixed in their inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (reſpectively) happened to be any of theſe daies: and yet we hear of no complaint from
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:43506:216"/> any, that by being deprived of their labour on one, or more, of the ſix daies upon ſuch an account, they were diſadvantaged, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed in the leaſt, for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath.

However, the Faſt preſcribed unto the <hi>Jews</hi> in captivity, by Queen <hi>Eſter,</hi> was required by her to be kept three daies together (the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion being very urgent and weighty) <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.16.

Indeed for perſons in authority to compell people to forſake their ordinary work on any of thoſe daies on which God hath either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or permitted them to work, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend either upon ſuch ordinances of devotion, which being of humane preſcription, are not like to have the quickening preſence of God in them, or be it upon ordinances of divine inſtitution, as preaching, faſting, giving of thanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the occaſions or grounds, upon which they are forced from their labours to attend them, are in preſence only warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

                     <p>I do not know that this Queſtion, or the matter of it was ever taken into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any of the reformed Churches abroad. Amongſt us, ſome both Miniſters, and private Chriſtians, have judged themſelves bound in conſcience to make diligent inquiry after the preciſe truth in the caſe, that ſo they might not, either through careleſneſſe, or ignorance, either take from, or add to, or alter any thing in the Commandement of God concerning the time of that holy reſt, which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. Theſe (as it ſeems) take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that God both under the Law, required of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and under the Goſpel requireth alſo of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not only an intire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat natural day, conſiſting of 24 houres to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:43506:217"/> be ſanctified for a day of an holy reſt, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the beginning of this day be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted from a preciſe fixed point of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſaid 24 houres. The former of theſe ſuppoſitions cannot well be admitted, either with reference unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Gentiles, at leaſt if we take the word, <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> or keep holy, (in the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) in the ſenſe wherein it is generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, in the opening of the Command, [namely for exerciſing our ſelves in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties] and extend it to the whole time of the 24 houres. For God (doubtleſſe) doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of men to ſanctifie (in this ſenſe) the ſaid whole day (conſiſting of 24 houres) which includes the night, as well as that, which we cal the day, nor more then about the one half of it, or rather ſuch a proportion of it, as they uſually beſtow in their ordinary labours on the other ſix daies. This the expreſſe words of the Commandement ſeem to imply: <hi>Six daies ſhalt thou labour</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid: the day of thy reſt, ſhall anſwer, or be the ſame, in duration with one of the <hi>ſix daies</hi> of thy labour: as the day of thine ordinary labour, ſo ſhall the day of thy ſacred reſt be. For the latter ſuppoſition, that we ſtand bound by precept from God to enter upon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the duties of the ſanctification of our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, at a fixed and determinate point of time (as either, in the evening of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:43506:217"/> day, when ſome hold the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi> beginneth, as the <hi>Iew</hi>'s Sabbath did; or in the morning, or firſt peep of the (arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial) day following, which is the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of profeſſors amongſt us; or, as ſome others conceive, at the midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; judging the Sabbath then to begin) the Suppoſition (I ſay) might take place in reference to the <hi>Iews,</hi> inhabiting in their own land, and their Sabbath (at leaſt with a very ſmall, and ſcarce-diſcernable variation) their countries being one and the ſame, and this of ſmall extent, in which reſpect, evenings, and mornings, began much about the ſame point of time in the moſt, diſtant parts of it.

In like manner, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are more the Prince's-his, or his to whom they owe Subjection, then he is their's. Now as it is naturall for men to love their own, in what reſpect or degree ſoever they be their own (whether they be things or perſons) ſo it is naturall alſo for them to love thoſe things or perſons more, (<hi>coeteris paribus,</hi> as we uſe to ſay) which are more their own, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their propriety is larger, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, then thoſe in either kind, which are leſſe their own. So then Parents (and there is a like conſideration of other ſuperiours, in reference to their inferiors reſpectively) being naturally more inclined to act the parts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents towards their Children, and to do that which becommeth them in reference unto
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:43506:223"/> them, then Children are to perform their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards their Parents; this may be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the reaſon why God in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, ſo expreſly chargeth Children with their duty towards their Parents, and Parents implicitly only, and conſequential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with theirs towards their Children.</p>

                        <hi>What may be the reaſon why a promiſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things ſhould be annexed to this fifth Commandement, and not any promiſe at all unto any other Commandement of the ſecond Table?</hi>

                     <p>It is a right obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that God is wont to ratifie and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his affirmative commands with promiſes and his negative with threatnings. The reaſon whereof may be, becauſe there is nothing in equity, or reaſon due unto the forbearance, or non-acting of ſin, and wickedneſſe, but freedome from puniſhment: whereas poſitive rewards are proper to be conferr'd upon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and worthy actions and good ſervices. Now all the reſt of the Commandements of the ſecond table, being negative or prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they are all ſanctioned, or ratified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by that threatning which comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them all, <hi>Curſed be he that continueth not in all things, &amp;c.

But why the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in this Commandement, ſhould be of temporall good things, rather then of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, this may be one reaſon; becauſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and younger perſons who are more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and in the firſt place minded in it, are more apprehenſive and capable of the good things of this life, then of that which is to come.

                        <hi>How doth the Apoſtle affirm this fifth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to be</hi> the firſt Commandement with promiſe (Eph. 6.2.) <hi>when as we find, as well a promiſe (as we formerly touched) as a threatning, in the ſecond Commandement; as namely that God will</hi> ſhew mercy unto thouſands of them that love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Whereas the Apoſtle's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the words mentioned, clearly is, that the fifth Commandent is the firſt, with an appropriate promiſe, and which is made in a particular and ſpecial manner to the due keeping of that Commandement unto which it is annexed. Neither doth he term it, the <hi>firſt Commandement with promiſe,</hi> as ſuppoſing that there is any more with <hi>promiſe</hi> alſo, after
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:43506:228"/> it; but only that there was none ſuch before it.

                     <p>The meaning of the common ſuppoſal you ſpeak of, is not that all kinds, or degrees of ſins againſt the former Commandements, are greater then any ſin that can be committed againſt any latter Command; but only this, that the higheſt degree of ſinning againſt a former Command, is more ſinful then the higheſt degree of ſinning againſt a latter. And I make little queſtion but that there may be greater ſins committed by Children, againſt Parents, and ſo againſt other Superiours, by thoſe that are under them, if not by Parents alſo againſt their Children and by Superiours againſt thoſe that are ſubject unto them, then the ſins of murther or adultery [conſidered ſimply as ſuch; and as tranſgreſſions of thoſe Commandements only, wherein they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly

                     <p>The duties here required, are either ſuch wherein we ſtand bound in reference unto our ſelves, for our own preſervations, or ſuch wherein we ſtand obliged unto others for theirs. In reſpect of our ſelves, we are here charged to maintain and keep up the vigour and activeneſſe of our minds and ſpirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſtrength and good habit of our bodies, that in both we may be ſerviceable both unto God and Men: and in order unto theſe ends, to converſe with the grounds of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> cheerfulneſſe, and to reſiſt all ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, motions, and inclinations which tend to an unprofitable ſadneſſe and lumpiſhneſs of ſoul; to be provident without diſtracting
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:43506:230"/> feares or cares; to allow unto our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient meat, drink, apparel, lodging, with ſeaſonable recreation, and phyſick; not to weary or waſte our bodies which immoderate labour, nor to ſoak them in exceſſiveneſſe of ſleep; not to oppreſſe or injure them with inordinate eating or drinking; not to expoſe our ſelves unto violence, or danger either from men, or in any other kind, but upon very warrantable and weighty occaſions, and vvhen we have good reaſon to judge our ſelves called by God hereunto; to prevent, or qualifie the fierceneſſe and bitterneſſe of mens Spirits againſt us, by giving them ſoft words, gentle anſwers, and ſhevving them kindneſſe (upon occaſion) to avoid the company of cholerique, quarrelſome, and angry men; to defend our ſelves with courage, and with weapons; if we be aſſaulted, to uſe the benefit of the law, if this be likely at any time to ſecure us in the poſſeſſion of our lives, or of the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of them, and there be no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable courſe to effect it; to commend the ſafe-guard of our lives unto God by Prayer, both by night and by day, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when upon his account we ſhall expoſe them unto any imminent perill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In reference unto others, God in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement requireth of us, that we be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and unfeignedly deſirous of their ſafety, well-fare, and peace, and that we endeavour our ſelves accordingly, upon all occaſions, to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:43506:230"/> promote and maintain them; that we rejoice at the goodneſſe of God towards them in their preſervation and health, that we be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſionate over them when they are either ſick, or in trouble, or in want, or in danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that we be cheerful and free in miniſtring unto them according to ability and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that we exerciſe patience towards them in beating wrongs, and hard meaſure from them, in forgiving the injuries they do us; in not deſpiſing them, or withdrawing our ſelves, our love, or reſpects from them, becauſe of ſome weakneſſes or wants in their words, or actions; that (ſalving a good conſcience) we avoid all occaſions of offending, grieving, troubling, or diſcontenting them, as by taking either their ſayings, or their doings, in an ill ſenſe, when they are capable of a good, by refuſing to hear, or to admit of ſuch a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or defence of themſelves (eſpecially if they be our inferiours) being accused or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, which is in any degree reaſonable, and fair, by denying them any ordinary, or mean courteſie, when they deſire it, by ſpeaking churliſhly or unfriendlily to them, by shewing any ſign of a neglect of them, by reproving them either unſeaſonably, or over-ſharply; by not yielding unto them in matters of leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, when they are confident that their demands are juſt and right (with many the like). In caſe we be moleſted with ſuits at Lave, not to omit any duty or ſervice of love
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:43506:231"/> towards thoſe that are thus injurious and vex atious in this kind unto us; that we ſtand by the poor and helpleſſe when he is unjuſtly queſtioned for his life, or otherwiſe wronged; and to deliver him, if we able. Briefly, that we be really careful, that no man whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive any harm from us, or ours, in his perſon by one means or other, but that we make conſcience both by our ſelves, and ours (as farre as we are able to prevail with them) to render the lives of all men not only ſafe, but comfortable alſo, as farre as we have means and opportunity; conſidering that a life which is uncomfortable is even in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture notion and account, a kind of death; yea and may (very poſſibly) have more evill in it then that which is commonly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Death.</hi> Therefore to do any thing willingly, and without a very juſt cauſe, which directly tendeth to make the life of any man uncomfortable, or leſſe deſirable unto him, is in Scripture ſenſe (and if ſo, before God) to murther him: Yea not to do that which is <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and meet for the comfort of him that is in diſtreſſe, or miſery, when we have means and opportunities to do it, is a miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of little better interpretation.</p>

                     <p>Theſe alſo (for the moſt part) may readily be underſtood by way of contrariety, from the ſins particularly forbidden (as you have now heard them rehearſed). Or however, take a few of them by their names, by which you may judge of their fellows. The duties then here commanded, beſides the abſtaining from all perpetrations of actual uncleanneſs, may be reduced under three heads. The firſt, conſcientiouſly to uſe all the means, that are proper and likely to create or raiſe in us a true
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:43506:234"/> love of a pure heart, and clean converſation. The ſecond, to uſe in like manner all means that are proper and likely to divert, ſcatter, and quench all luſtful motions, inclinations, and deſires. The third (and laſt) carefully to avoid all occaſions and opportunities for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean practiſes. Of the firſt ſort are theſe (with ſome others) diligently to acquaint our ſelves from the Scriptures with all thoſe grounds, from which the great love of God unto, and the delight which he taketh in, the purity and cleanneſs of the hearts, and lives of men, may clearly be concluded; as the conformity hereof unto himſelf, or his own nature, (which upon all occaſions he declares to be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi>) the frequent and weighty commands which he layeth upon men and women to keep themſelves chaſte, and pure, and unſpotted of the flesh, the promiſes that he maketh unto thoſe, that ſhall obey him in ſuch his commands, the great bleſſings that he hath heaped upon thoſe that have been obedient unto him herein, the moſt effectual and preſſing motives (with ſutable directions) by which he ſeeketh to perſwade men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men unto that wherein his Soul ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in this kind; the effectualneſs of the means which he hath preſcribed to render his command for puritie and holineſs, paſſable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough unto fleſh and blood, and no waies grievous, and more eſpecially (among the reſt) the ordinance of marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So again, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:43506:235"/> to conſider with what peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they (moſt commonly, and unleſs they forfeit theſe bleſſings by ſome other great wickedneſs, or folly) both live and dye, who (in the Apoſtles language) have <hi>poſſeſſed their veſſels in ſanctification and honour, and not in the luſts of concupiſcence,</hi> or uncleanneſs, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe who have ſold themſelves to commit Adulterie, Fornication, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pollution of the fleſh. Of the ſecond ſort are theſe (and such like) to lay our Souls and Conſciences cloſe to thoſe terrible and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory threatnings of excluſion from the Kingdome of God, which the Holy Ghoſt in many places in Scripture expreſly denounceth againſt all thoſe that ſhall walk in the luſts of uncleanneſs; to conſider how virulent an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie all impurity in this kind, hath to that nature of God in which be commandeth us (in ſpecial manner) to be like unto him (I mean, his holineſs and purity) to remember how often his wrath hath been revealed from Heaven againſt men and women of unclean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; and ſo, with what ſeverity he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth perſons of both ſexes to abſtain from fornication, adulterie, and all other fleſhly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities; to recount how proper and effectual a courſe he hath taken to render all unclean perſons inexcuſable, <hi>viz.</hi> by contriving and allowing unto them his ordinance of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, a means honourable, agreeable to their natures, and fully ſufficient (at leaſt where it
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:43506:235"/> is not diſabled by an high hand of wickedneſs to preſerve them from all defilements of the fleſh. So alſo to conſider, what a ſad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition, even in this world, very many have brought themſelves unto, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean practiſes, loſeing their credits, expoſing themſelves to contempt and ſcorn, waſting their eſtates, undoing their poſterities (if they have any) ruining their families, diſgraceing their friends, waſting their ſtrength, filling their bodies with very grievous, noiſome, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſhameful diſeaſes, ſo deſtroying their lives before their time, and dying one of the worſt kinds of ſelf-murtherers, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them the ſtench and rottenneſs of their bodies in their names and memories; in like manner to conſider, how many thouſand times more grievous and terrible then all this it muſt needs be, to die under the conſcience and guilt of ſo much ſin and wickedneſs; and withall, that no man ever committed any act of uncleanneſs, but was arreſted with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſcontent immediately upon it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head alſo are comprehended theſe, and ſuch like duties, to imploy our ſelves in ſome honeſt labour and courſe of life, and not to ſuffer either our minds, or our bodies, to diſpoſe themſelves unto wantonneſs by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſloth, to be temperate in our diet, not affecting meat or drinks of high nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (when we are in health) or invented to inflame or nouriſh luſt: moderate in our ſleep,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:43506:236"/> ſober in our apparel, modeſt and grave in our behaviour, favourie in our ſpeech and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: or if by a conſcientious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of all theſe, we cannot arrive at the bleſſing of a ſtable and perfect frame of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, but that we are ſtill purſued with inclinations and motions another way, then to take ſanctuary at the ordinance of marriage and therein ſo to live and converſe with her, or him, whom God ſhall give into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that there may be a mutual confidence of each in other, no occaſion in one kind or other being given on either ſide, of the leaſt jealouſie of unfaithfulneſſe, or want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall affections, in either towards other. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the third (and laſt) head, theſe duties (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſome others of like conſideration) are compriſed; To withdraw from our familiar friends and acquaintances, as faſt as convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may, when we underſtand that a ſpirit of uncleanneſſe is entered into them, and they refuſe, after the firſt and ſecond admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to repent and reform; not to entertain others of like ſinful character: to avoid pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacie with ſuch perſons, who may in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, eſpecially by means of the opportunitie, awaken the luſt of concupiſcence within us, which before was faſt aſleep; not to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly pleaſant, or ſportful, men with women, or women with men, either in talk or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, though before company, but only with their own yoke-fellows: not to come within
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:43506:236"/> the doors of houſes commonly ſuſpected of uncleanneſs, unleſſe (haply) upon ſome ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſion, and then to haſten our retreat all we can; not to look narrowly or long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the comlineſs, or beauty of a perſon of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſex, (our own yoke-fellow in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age only excepted) not to contemplate or feed upon the remembrance of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides theſe things, and ſuch like in reference to our ſelves, the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chargeth us by all lawful and good means as much as in us lyeth, to prevent all acts of impurity in others, and more eſpecially in perſons related unto us; as in our Children by diſpoſing them timely in marriage, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be, and opportunity ſerve; and in the mean time, conſcientiouſly to endeavour, what by prudent inſtructions, what by our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary ſoberneſſe and gravity, and what by diſcreet government and nurture, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them unſpotted and undefiled unto the day thereof. We are debtours likewiſe unto our Servants, whileſt they remain in our ſervice, to endeavour by all the three means laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to keep them chaſte alſo, and free from pollutions in the fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:43506:244"/> frame of our hearts or minds, to a congruity with our condition, whatever it be, (for this alteration may be made under any condition) becauſe contentment is nothing elſe but the reſult or proper effect of ſuch a congruity. No badneſſe of the outward condition is able to cauſe diſcontent, uleſſe the mind be of the conſpiracy, by refuſing to comport with it, or to work it ſelf into ſuch a temper and frame, wherein it will reſent little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the beſt and the worſt of earthly conditions. For, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>That here is neither male nor female, neither bond nor free,</hi> but that all are one in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt is all, Gal.</hi> 3.28. compared with <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. [meaning that all the priviledges of this world, whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or civil, are drowned in that abundant bleſſedneſſe, which comes upon men by <hi>Chriſt</hi> believed on, even as the higheſt hils and mountains in the Earth, were covered as well as the mole-hils or vallies, by the prevailing waters of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.19, 20.]. In like manner to a mind that is raiſed and lifted up by faith, to converſe much within the vail, and feedeth heartily upon the hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the great things of the world to come; the difference between riches and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, honour and diſhonour, liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, between a ſmiling and a frowning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this preſent world, are contracted into a very narrow compaſſe, and make a
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:43506:244"/> perſon little ſenſible of contentment in the one, or diſcontent in the other. What, or who hindreth, but that every man may caſt in his lot, and take part with him, who <hi>knew how to be abaſed, and how to abound,</hi> and was <hi>inſtructed both to be full, and to be hungry,</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12.) profeſſing of himſelf, that he was <hi>as ſorrowful,</hi> [his afflicted condition in the world, making him ſo to appear] <hi>yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes rejoycing; as having nothing, and yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.10. The more rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apaid any perſon, man or woman, ſhall be in the inner man, the leſſe delinquent will they be found againſt this laſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And let this ſuffice for anſwer to your laſt queſtion, and put a period to our preſent diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>Queſtion. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WHat is a Sacrament?</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Sacrament in general (as Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> at leaſt, the Proteſtant, or ſounder party of them, have appropriated the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word to themſelves, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43506:247"/> for it is not found in the Scriptures, nor any other word equivalent in ſenſe, or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to it) may be thus deſcribed. It is a Sacred Rite, Ordinance, or eternal Service in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and preſcribed by God, partly for the repreſentation, partly for the confirmation of ſome ſpiritual priviledge, great benefit, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which he hath promiſed in his word unto perſons ſo qualified, as he requireth in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (I mean to make them capable, or meet to receive them.) This definition, or deſcription, includes as well the adminiſtration, and recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is commonly called the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Sacrament, as this matter it ſelf; which notwithſtanding is ſometimes termed a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> without either of thoſe; as when we call Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover, Sacraments of the old Teſtament; and ſo Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper, Sacraments of the New. But taking the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as denoting a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Ordinance, or Inſtitution (which is the better, and more uſual ſignification of the word amongſt us) ſo it importeth as well (or indeed, rather) that which is to be done, with or about, the matter of it, as this matter it ſelf. Thus it is more proper to ſay (if not more true alſo) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> appointed the celebration [that is, the ſolemn, both Adminiſtration, and Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving] of his Supper, then his Supper it ſelf, or the element of Bread and Wine, which are the materials of it. There is the like conſideration of the reſt.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43506:247"/>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>If the word</hi> Sacrament <hi>be not found in the Scriptures, nor any that anſwereth it in ſenſe, or ſignification, how cometh it to be taken in by</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>into the concernments of their profeſſion, and be of that familiar, and frequent uſe amongſt them, as it is known to be? Or what is the nature or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification of it, in that language (the Latine) from which it is borrowed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although all things which in reſpect of their poſitive and particular natures, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yea, or meet to be known, and believed by <hi>Christians</hi> (in matters appertaining unto God) be ſufficiently, and in words ſignificant, and proper enough, expreſſed in the Scriptures; yet the relations of ſome of theſe things unto others of them, their mutual proportions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, congruities, oppoſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are left to be obſerved and conſidered, by the light of reaſon and underſtanding in men, and which there maybe good occaſion (ſomtimes) to mention, argue, and diſcourſe, are not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in ſuch particularity of words: So that for the expreſſion and explication of theſe, there may be a kinde of neceſſity for <hi>Christian</hi> Writers, and Teachers, to look out into the language that is uſed by other men, for words and phraſes that are moſt commodious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for ſuch a purpoſe. Upon this account, ſuch terms as theſe, <hi>Trinity, Conſubſtantial,</hi> or <hi>Co-eſſential, Co-eternal</hi> (with ſome others) have been from amongſt forreign ſpeakers, brought in to the School, or Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43506:248"/> the better opening of the great myſtery of the Three in One, and One in Three, in the Divine Nature. In like manner, the ancient and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Teachers of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, obſerving a certain ſympathy or agreement in nature, or in ſeveral main circumſtances, between ſeveral Ordinances, or external Services, enjoyned by Divine Authority to be obſerved by perſons profeſſing the true Religion, and finding fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſion to ſpeak, and treat of this their agreement, they adopted the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> (which before either was a ſtranger in matters of their profeſſion, or however, to any ſuch ſignification, or ſervice as that, unto which it was now called) to declare and expreſs it, as judging it (it ſeems) the moſt commodious and beſt fitting term they could think of for ſuch a purpoſe. The uſe of the word amongſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> is very ancient; only it was for a long time uſed by the Fathers, in a more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive ſignification, then only to ſignifie that peculiar and ſpecial kinde of Ordinance, unto which the Proteſtant Religion hath now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained it, by aſſerting two <hi>Sacraments</hi> only. And this more lax and indiſtinct ſignification of it in the Writings of the Fathers, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſnare unto the Papiſts, who cannot at this day be contented with fewer then ſeven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and theſe ſtrictly and properly ſo called (for othewiſe, I find ſome of our learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants willing to give them content in allowing them ſeven <hi>Sacraments,</hi> (yea, and more then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43506:248"/> if it would ſatisfie them to take them in the large ſignification of the word) being at firſt led into the by-way of this error (now become a great pillar of their <hi>Criſtianity,</hi> and thoſe ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized by them into Hell, (that ſhall deny it) by their great Maſter <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> who put this branch to their noſe about the year 1160. And the troubleſomneſs of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with the ambiguity and abuſe of the word, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſome of our learned Reformers in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> as <hi>Zuinglis, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Melancton,</hi> half to wiſh that it had never come, or been uſed, amongſt them; who notwithſtanding for peace ſake, and being unprovided of another word according to their mindes for their purpoſe, frequently uſed it.</p>
                     <p>To the latter part of your queſtion, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine word <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> [engliſhed, a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>] before it was <hi>Chriſtianized,</hi> had three ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications: 1. It ſignified any ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney depoſited by him that would contend in Law, which he was to loſe, and forfeit to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick treaſury, in caſe ſentence went againſt him. 2. It ſignified any tranſaction or buſineſs, about which an Oath was uſed. 3. (And laſtly) It moſt properly or frequently ſignified a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Oath, by which Souldiers ſwore fidelity to their Emperor, or Commander in chief, when they were taken into the Army. This laſt notion or ſignification of the word, was (in all likelihood) that, which was chiefly minded by the ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi> when they firſt uſed it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43506:249"/> in matters of their Religion (whereunto like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might be the rather induced by the notation, or etymology of the word, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth <hi>holineſs</hi>)</p>
                     <p>Queſtion 3. <hi>May there any reaſon be given of the Counſel of God in adorning, or ſetting forth</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Religion, with ſuch Rites and Ordinances, as theſe we call</hi> Sacraments?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God being of all others the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and wiſe Agent, cannot be thought to do any thing of meer will and pleaſure, no nor yet without the moſt choice, ſavory, and profound reaſons, motives, or ends, of which any of his diſpenſations, or actions, are any wayes capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is the Apoſtles Doctrine, that <hi>he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> [not any thing, ſimply and abſolutely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, but] <hi>all things according to the counſel of his will,</hi> Epheſ. 1.11. Only that is to be minded, that the word <hi>counſel,</hi> when it is (as here) aſcribed unto God, doth not imply any faculty, or act, of deliberating, debating, conſidering, or the like (for theſe, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and commendable in men, yet ſuppoſing imperfection, as, <hi>viz.</hi> the want of knowing, at leaſt for a time, what is beſt to be done, are not attributeable unto God) but his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, conſidered as dictating, or preſenting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>will,</hi> all the reſolves (with their grounds and reaſons) and theſe only, which are honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, meet and worthy to be paſſed, willed, or concluded by it; or if, after the manner of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and well adviſed men, he had been long in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43506:249"/> conſultation with himſelf about the forming, molding and contriving of them, in regard of the moſt exquiſite and profound contrivements of them. So it need be no queſtion, but that there are reaſons, why God ſhould appoint a place for Sacramental ordinances in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enjoyn the obſervance of them in the exerciſe of it. Nor is it hard to deſcry, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, one, or more of theſe reaſons. For as the univerſe or great body of the Creation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of things viſible, and inviſible; ſo are the wayes and diſpenſations of God (for the moſt part) founded upon grounds and reaſons, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceptible, and diſcoverable, partly hidden, and paſt finding out. And this I judge to be the caſe about the reaſons of Gods planting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Rites in the Field of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Some of theſe reaſons are on this ſide the line of Humane perception (and it may be) others of them beyond it.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion. 4. <hi>What are, or what may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are aſſignable by men, of that dispoſition of God, whereof we now ſpeak?</hi>

So under the Goſpel ſtate of it, which (as was even now intimated) is its middle age, or youth, having ſomewhat both of the weakneſs and imperfection of its childehood, and ſomewhat alſo of the ſtrength and perfection of its heavenly ſtature or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſome few external Rites, or Ordinances are proper and uſeful for it, in reſpect of what is yet weak and defective in it, but a multitude, or any greater number of ſuch Ordinances, would be improper, and no wayes neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, by reaſon of thoſe degrees of ſtrength, and its manlike ſtate, unto which it is advanced.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43506:251"/> or more proper way or means in this caſe to relieve the defect of the viſive faculty of this eye, then to cloath theſe ſpiritual objects with as much external ſenſibility, as well may be; eſpecially if this cloathing be dexterouſly and wiſely fitted unto the nature of them. Such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or device us this draweth the ſaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects much nearer unto the eye of Faith, and withal, ſo ſo refracteth, accommodateth, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempereth the ſpirituality of them unto this eye, that notwithſtanding the weakneſs of it, it is hereby inabled to behold them more ſteadily and to contemplate and conſider them with leſs trouble, or burthenſomneſs unto it, as the vail or covering which <hi>Moſes</hi> put upon his face, when it ſhone with that brightneſs, that both <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people were afraid to come near him, ſo qualified, or reduced the diſproportion of the object to their weak ſenſes, that by means thereof they were able to draw near to it, and to commune with him familiarly, and without any offence or trouble, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.30 33. In like manner the glorious perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> together with thoſe ſpiritual and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous priviledges, Union and Communion with him, ſanctification and forgiveneſs of ſins (which are the ſum, ſubſtance, and effect, of the whole Goſpel, vertually and implicitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or including in them, all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars lying within the compaſs thereof) are, in the Sacramental Ordinances of the Goſpel, brought down as near, and as dexterouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated unto all the outward ſenſes, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43506:251"/> their ſpiritual and ſublime natures would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: by the opportun ty and means whereof, the weakneſs of the eye of Faith muſt needs be much refreſhed, ſtrengthened, enabled, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to converſe more frequently and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with them, and to meditate of them with leſs diſtraction, and with more compoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fixedneſs of minde Beſides, when the things that are to be believed are exceeding great, and the performance or doing them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary courſe of things, and common grounds in reaſon, hard to be believed it is ſome eaſe and advantage to our Faith, wherewith they are to be believed, to ſee ſuch things done, which carry any lively reſemblance or l keneſs unto them. He that ſhould promiſe to build us an houſe, ſtrong, and of good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and every wayes convenient for our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, ſhould, to a degree, quicken our faith to believe him in ſuch a promiſe, if he ſhould at preſent make, and deliver unto us, an exact pattern, or model, though made of paper, paſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, or of any ſuch light matter, of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial building, which according to promiſe, he intends after a while to build for us, and to inveſt us with. That paſſage of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (<hi>John</hi> 3.12.) gives credit and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance not a little, to this reaſon. <hi>if I have told you earthly things, and ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me; how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> meaning, that if they did not apprehend and believe the truth and certainty of the ſpiritual or new birth, now he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43506:252"/> plained and ſet before them the nature and manner of it, in things obvious to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes (as, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſimilitudes of the natural, or carnal birth, and the winde) they would be much farther off from believing him, if he ſhould diſcourſe unto them of ſpiritual and heavenly things in the dialect, or language of Angels, without accommodating them to their underſtandings and belief by Figures, or reſemblances, borrowed from earthly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things. So when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having opened theſe ſimilitudes, or parables unto his diſciples, wherein he had taught the ſecrets of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, demanded of them, <hi>Have ye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all theſe things,</hi> [meaning with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and erſtanding] <hi>they</hi> made him anſwer, <hi>Yea Lord, Mat.</hi> 13.51. Which ſheweth, that things myſterious &amp; ſpiritual may be the better and more readily apprehended, and believed, when they are propounded, or held forth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men in apt and proper reſemblances, of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and known things, and theſe reſemblances dexterouſly explained, and applied unto them. The like might be argued from the former part of his anſwer to this queſtion of his Diſciples, <hi>Why ſpeaked thou unto them</hi> [the people] <hi>in parables?</hi> ver. 10. <hi>He anſwered and ſaid unto them, becauſe it is given unto you to know</hi> [that is, to have the beſt and moſt effecteal means, whereby to know] <hi>the myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> and clearly implying, that one reaſon why he taught heavenly things ſo much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43506:252"/> in parables, was, that they, to whom he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alwayes to unfold them (<hi>Mark</hi> 4.34.) might, by means of both opportunities, the one of the Text, or Doctrine, the other, of the gloſs or expoſition, more readily attain unto both the underſtanding and belief of them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it lieth (it ſeems) within the confines of the light of nature, to conceive, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the wiſdom and goodneſs of God have judged it meet (as ſome of the <hi>Platonique</hi> addiction expreſs it) <hi>Uno ſigillo diverſas ſignare materias,</hi> i.e. to ſet the ſame ſeal or ſtamp upon different matters: their meaning is, to contrive and make this inferior and material world, and the ſuperior and inviſible world, to correſpond each with other in analogies, and proportions between natures and properties of the things contained in, or relating unto, the one and the other (reſpectively) yea, it is a received notion among the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors. <hi>Opera creationis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternae, habere in ſe imaginem creationis internae,</hi> i. e. the works of the outward Creation, carry in them the image [or likeneſs] of the inward [Creation.] And the truth is, that he that ſhall diligently, and with a diſcurſive underſtanding, conſider, how the Scriptures, in ſetting forth and diſcourſing ſpiritual and heavenly things, aboundeth with metaphors, parables, and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes taken from things that are earthly, and yet further, that very frequently they expreſſe, or call, ſpiritual things, by the very names, wherewith material, or earthly things are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43506:253"/> by reaſon of ſome lively reſemblance, or likeneſs between them: be (I ſay) that ſhall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ponder theſe things, and follow the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tendency and guidance of them, cannot (lightly) but e're long arrive at this concluſion, that this viſible and terrene world was molded and formed by God with a kinde of ſubſervient conformity to the world of inviſible things; o ſubſervient I mean, in ſpecial reference unto men, as namely, that theſe, being naturally, and without much care or endeavor, acquainted with this preſent world, wherewith, as being members of it, they converſe daily, might by the opportunity of this their knowledge, be the more capable, not only of conceiving or apprehending aright, but even of believing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the things of the other world, when God ſhould cauſe theſe to be declared, or preached unto them in and by their reſpective parallels of earth y things. As for inſtance, men ſeeing and knowing that God hath made ſuch an earthly element as water, which is proper to cleanſe, and to ſeparate, and waſh off any ſoil, or material filth, that is contracted by, or clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto, their fleſh or bodies; they are hereby taught, and aſſured (the ſaid propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or parallel, between the two worlds, and their reſpective furnitures, or things found in the one, and in the other, ſuppoſed) that there is ſomewhat in the other (the inviſible) world that is proper and effectual, for the purging or cleanſing their ſouls and conſciences from the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43506:253"/> ſpiritual filth or defilement of ſin. And when it ſhall be declared unto men that this inviſible or heavenly water, which is ſo effectual and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the waſhing of the ſoul from ſin, is the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this doctrine, upon the advantage of the ſaid ſuppoſition, muſt needs come to their reaſons and judgements, with much credibility, and likelihood of truth; eſpecially if it be conſidered withal, that there was never any thing reported, or heard of by any tidings from or out of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world, that had the property of waſhing and cleanſing the conſcience from ſin, veſted in it, but this blood only; and yet farther, that is not imaginable, that there ſhould be any other thing in this world it ſelf (I mean the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world) alike proper for ſuch a purpoſe. There is the ſame conſideration of the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bread and Wine of this world, with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and known properties, and ends, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Bread and Wine of that other world, and thoſe properties and effects, which the Scripture attributeth unto them. So then, if the notion of the ſympathetical accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two worlds, which hath been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and which (as you have heard) is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured (if not ſomewhat more) by the Scriptures themſelves, will abide the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and ſhall be found a truth, the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of Sacramental Ordinances for the quickening, incouraging, and ſupporting of Faith, will recieve much evidence and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43506:254"/> by it. Or however, there being an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, or reſemblance between thoſe material and ſenſible things, which have part and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in theſe Ordinances, and thoſe heavenly things, or matters of Faith, which are here in their natures repreſented, and in their reallity and truth ratified, and confirmed, the ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances muſt needs be ſubſervient unto Faith, and to the joy thereof, partly by occaſioning, or cauſing more effectual and lively impreſſions of the things to be believed, upon the mindes and ſpirits of men, then are uſually wrought by hearings; partly alſo, and more eſpecially, by fixing or faſtening them in their mindes or memories, with leſs danger of loſing them, or ſuffering by the forgetfulneſs, vaniſhing, or ſlipping away of them. For as a ſmall key (or the like) being faſtened and tied to a greater, or to ſome other thing of greater bulk, is not ſo ſoon loſt, as when it is carried, or worn, alone: ſo neither are ſpiritual, or heavenly things ſo apt to vaniſh, or ſlip out of the mindes of men, when they are delivered unto and received by them coupled with material and outward things, theſe not being any way likely to be forgotten by them, not (conſequently) any thing that is faſtened to them. This then may be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Counſel of God in thoſe Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Figures, Rites, or Ordinances, which he hath judged meet to plant in the Paradiſe of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, the accomodation of the Faith of the profeſſors thereof.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The two Nations that had been in the womb of the world (I mean, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi>) until the bleſſing of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, were now under this, and by means of it, according to the gracious Counſel and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, to be united, and made one and the ſame body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16 3.6. Now one of theſe Nations, the <hi>Jews,</hi> having from their forefathers, for many ages together, been trained up in a Religion, and this unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and in a very extraordinary manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto, and impoſed on them by God, which conſiſted of a multitude, and great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of external Rites, and ſignificant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, would in all likelihood, have been much more averſe from the embracing of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion, if it had in no degree at all ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolized with that, which they had received from their Forefathers, and ſo lately profeſſed. And upon this account the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> remin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, (upon occaſion) of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſignificant Ceremony of Baptiſme in <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> as ſupplying the want of their <hi>(cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> endeavouring and hoping by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

So that very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that one reaſon why God was pleaſed to temper the body of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> with Sacramental inſtitutions in the frame of it, was to render it the more acceſſible unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> as having by this means ſomewhat in it of the notion and nature of that Religion, which they and their Fathers for many generations (as was ſaid) had profeſſed, and unto which, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they were very importunely addicted and devoted. For, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That unto the Jews he became as a Jew</hi> [that is, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or ſubjected, himſelf to many of their humors, and practices] <hi>that he might gain the Jews,</hi> (1 Cor. 9.20.) So may it (with reverence, and ſpeaking after the manner of men) be ſaid of God himſelf, that he alſo in modelling the ſcheme, or body, of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> became a <hi>Jew,</hi> [condeſcended to the weakneſs of the <hi>Jewiſh genius</hi>] that he might the better <hi>gain the Jews</hi> thereunto. So that as the multitude of Rites and Ceremonies in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, whilſt they continued, were as a <hi>partition wall,</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2 14.) that ſeparated, or divided, the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Gentiles: So on the contrary, the few Ceremonies inſerted, and implanted in <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> are a means contributing (and ſo intended by God) towards the healing of this ſeparation; and reconciling the two Nations into one.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>What may be a third reaſon, why</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43506:255"/> Chriſtianity <hi>was ſet forth by God, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the world with Sacramental Ordinances in the frame, or fabrick of u?</hi>

The reaſon why God thus treateth with men (I mean, by their own principles, and according to the terms on which they deal one with another) may be, becauſe thoſe dictates of the light of nature, by which all rational and civil converſe amongſt men is managed and maintained, are the ſame with thoſe impreſſions of wiſdom and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the divine nature, by which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it moſt for his glory, and moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alſo, and beneficial, for his creature man,

Now then it being a frequent cuſtom (and this not uſeleſs, or without ground) amongſt men, who live in a civil community diſtinct from all others, to require of thoſe, who deſire admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into their ſociety, and to partake of the priviledges, and conveniences, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by the members of it, to ſubmit unto ſome Ceremony or other (ſuch as they have thought good to appropriate in this kinde unto themſelves) at the time of their admittance hereinto; yea, and afterwards, whilſt they continue members of their Community, at times, and upon ſpecial occaſion, to profeſs their relation hereunto, either by wearing ſome diſtinct habit (ſignificative hereof) or by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome ſervices, whereunto, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe and cuſtom of the ſociety, they ſhall be called; it ſeemed good in the ſight of God, to accommodate the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion unto theſe, or the like uſages amongſt men, by impoſing it as a law upon all that ſhould deſire part and fellowſhip in the great and holy community of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves unto thoſe Ceremonies, Rites, or Sacramental Ordinances, which he, by his great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Any promiſe or undertaking, made, profeſſed, and declared, not by words only, but with, and by ſome Ceremony, or Solemnity of action likewiſe, is more ſtrongly binding, and ingaging, and the falling off, or turning aſide from either, the more diſhonorable, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto reproach, or puniſhment, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then if they had been uttered, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd only in words. The ſubſcribing with a mans hand, and the affixing of his Seal, make a Bond, or Covenant in writing the more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, and binding, not only in Law (which gives no force or validity at all to a writing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſcribed, and without a Seal annexed but in equity and reaſon alſo. There is much the ſame conſideration of both caſes. For there is in both a repetition, or ſecond acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (if not a third) of a mans conſent, and purpoſe, to ſtand to what he promiſeth, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh: and conſequently, a clear and diſtinct acknowledgement, that he hath not been ſurprized, or inconſiderately drawn into ſuch his engagements, but hath deliberately, and time after time digeſted the import, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43506:257"/> of them. And to recede, or go back from any thing, which hath been undertaken, or promiſed upon ſuch terms as theſe, argueth a very high degree of unworthineſs in men, and that they are not fit for humane ſociety, or converſe. For when, or in what caſes can a man be truſted, or his profeſſion, or words, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon, if not when he ſolemnly, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledgeth, and this over and over, yea, and not by words only, but by actions (which both naturally, and cuſtomarily, have more of the hearts of men in them, then bare words) deviſed, and intended to declare and ſignifie the full and abſolute purpoſe or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men to do, and to perform, what they have promiſed, profeſſed, or undertaken? Now then, God, deſirous to prevent that moſt horrid, and ſoul threatning ſin of Apoſtaſie (with all ſinful demeanors diſpoſing unto it in thoſe that ſhould ever enter into the profeſſion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed to render it as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and reproachful unto men, as hateful and dreadful to their conſciences, as lightly could be, by cauſing it both to be undertaken at firſt, and to be managed alſo afterwards, with the open and publick obſervance of ſuch Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rites, which he contrived on purpoſe (and hath declared accordingly) to perſwade and prevail with them to cleave faſt and cloſe to that their profeſſion unto the end. It is much more eaſie for the weak and fooliſh heart of a man to refrain ſuch ſins, which he either knows,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43506:257"/> or hath rational and convincing grounds to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, will either certainly ruine and deſtroy him, or elſe make a very ſore and wide breach upon his comfort and peace; yea, though he be very inclinable, and many wayes tempted unto them, then thoſe, that are of a leſſe threatning, import in his eye, being equally ſollicited, or diſpoſed, unto them.</p>

So that the Sacraments we ſpeak of, according to the moſt gracious counſel and intent of him, that hath armed them, as they are ſtrongly and moſt ſeverely engaging upon men, who ſubmit unto, and uſe them, unto their profeſſion; ſo are they no leſs (if not rather more) ingaging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that hath given them (I mean, God) unto his profeſſion alſo [that is, as was intels hinted, to perform with all conſtancy and faithfulneſs, all thoſe terms of grace, love, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bounty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in the Goſpel he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth unto all thoſe, who love him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43506:258"/> his high diſhonor; even as his bow in the Clouds alſo would, in caſe he ſhould deſtroy the world with a ſtood any more.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion. 11. <hi>How doth it, or may it appear that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God to ſerve, in the nature or property of Seals, for the full confirmation, and final ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the truth of the Goſpel, and of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes here? or that he is deſirous that men ſhould conceive of them, as obliging him, as being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and impoſor of them, to make good the gracious contents of the Goſpel, or (which comes to the ſame) all things ſignified and imported in them [the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments] themſelves?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Concerning Circumciſion, which was one of the greateſt, and moſt properly called Sacraments, of the Old Teſtament, it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>Abraham received the ſign of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> [<hi>i.</hi> circumciſion, which was a ſign, or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant character] <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith</hi> [or, of that faith. <hi>i. e.</hi> of that kinde of Faith] <hi>which he had yet, being uncircumciſed,</hi> (Rom. 4.11.) This is not ſpoken of <hi>Abrahams</hi> being circumciſed, or of his reception of Circumciſion in his fleſh, (nor of his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or being made righteous in particular) but of his receiving order and command from God for the uſe and practice of Circumciſion by all the males of his Family and Poſterity, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10) although himſelf was to ſubmit unto it alſo with them. The word, <hi>received,</hi> is uſed in ſuch a ſenſe elſewhere, 1 <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:43506:259"/> 11.23.15.3. In this ſence <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> may be ſaid to have <hi>received</hi> from God the Sign or Ordinance, of Baptiſm, and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have received from God the Revelation ſent unto, and recorded by his Apoſtle <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.1. when it is ſaid, that <hi>Abraham received the ſign of circumciſion, a Seal of the righteouſneſs of the Faith,</hi> which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the clear meaning is, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Circumciſion unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it upon him, his family, and poſterity, with a purpoſe and intent that it ſhould be reſented and underſtood both by him and them, as a ſign given them, that whoſoever ſhould truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, whilſt he was yet uncircumciſed, ſhould upon the account of ſuch their Faith, be juſtified, or accepted as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by him. Now the ſtate of righteouſneſs or juſtification implicitly, vertually, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential way, comprehending in it all the good things, and bleſſings from firſt to laſt, which the Goſpel promiſeth: as ſometimes the head, or firſt Founder, and ſometimes ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Anceſtor is made the ſignificate of their whole race and poſterity, and uſed to expreſs them as <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.17, 18.18.19. So <hi>Jacob,</hi> (often his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. with others.) So <hi>Juſtification,</hi> being (as it were) an head priviledge, or benefit of the Goſpel highly conſiderable, may well ſignifie and import the whole ſyſtem and ſucceſſion of all the good and great things promiſed in the Goſpel. And thus I conceive it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43506:259"/> 
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>For Chriſt did not riſe again for our juſtification,</hi> onely, but for the procuring and obtaining all other benefits and bleſſings alſo, which are conſequential unto juſtification (as the Scriptures teſtifie in ſeveral places) In this ſenſe it is likewiſe to be taken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. and elſewhere it is interpreted by bleſſedneſs, as by a word of a parallel import, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. the ſealing, or confirming, of the promiſe hereof, is, interpretatively, and in effect, the ſealing and ratifying the contents of the whole Goſpel, and of all the promiſes in it. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the New Teſtament are of the ſame conſideration and import ſealing, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the faithfulneſs of God, in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all things promiſed in the Goſpel, unto thoſe that believe. Concerning Baptiſm, the brief deſcription of it, which we have, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3. clearly evinceth it. In both theſe places <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>preached the Baptiſm</hi> [that is, the doctrine of the Baptiſm] <hi>of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> the meaning is, that he preached and declared unto all that came to him, that he had received from God a new Ordinance, unto which he ſtrictly required and charged them to ſubmit, <hi>viz. Baptiſm,</hi> or ſuch a wasſhing, which much differed in ſignification and import from all thoſe, with which they had been acquainted hitherto, this being given, or ſent, by God unto them, to ſignifie and aſſure them, of the forgiveneſs of their ſins upon their repentance. The expreſſion (by the way) or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43506:260"/> phraſe of ſtilling Baptiſm, <hi>the Baptiſm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> much reſembleth that of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> concerning the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by direction from him, ſhot out of the window: this arrow as it went from the Kings hand, the Prophet termed, <hi>The arrow of the Lords deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria,</hi> [meaning, that the ſhooting of it by the King in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner directed by the Prophet, was a ſign and pledge from God, that he would deliver the King and his people, from under the power of the <hi>Syrians,</hi>] 2 Kings 13.17. So is Baptiſm, a ſign from Heaven, or a pledge of aſſurance from God, that unto <hi>Repentance</hi> he will alwayes grant <hi>remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Now <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> which is promiſed unto repentance, and this promiſe ſealed and confirmed by Baptiſm is the ſelf ſame thing with <hi>the righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> This is briefly touched, cap. 5. in anſwer to the fourth queſtion, and afterwards, and is clearly delivered by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. v. 5.6, 7. (compared) I mean, that the righteouſneſs of Faith, or juſtification, conſiſteth in remiſſion of ſins, [that is, the righteouſneſs promiſed unto, and obtained by Faith] of which [or of the promiſe of which] circumciſion (as was lately ſaid) was a <hi>ſign,</hi> and <hi>ſeal,</hi> under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For whether Faith, and Repentance, be the ſame thing, really, and materially, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in conſideration or reſpect, or whether they be not (a point briefly touched in anſwer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43506:260"/> to the fourteenth queſtion of the fifth Chapter) certain it is, that they are ſo parallel in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects with God, that they are both dignified with the great and precious promiſes both of Juſtification, and ſalvation (as was alſo ſhewed in the ſame Chapter.) So that the Sacrament of Baptiſme, being a confirmatory ſign from God of his promiſe of juſtification or forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, to all that ſhall truly repent is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively, and in effect, (as was lately argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the caſe of Circumciſion) a ſecuring pledge from him, that the whole Goſpel ſhall, from the leaſt to the greateſt, from the loweſt to the higheſt, of all the promiſes in it, be performed and made good by him unto the world. There is the ſame conſideration of the Sacramental Ordinance of the Supper likewiſe. For this is not only, or barely commemorative of the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (although a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what hath been done, being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and kept on foot, from the time of the doing it, hath a great confirmation in it unto after times, of the truth of it, and that it was done) but was intended further by the founder of it, for a ſignificant pledge unto men, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for the remiſſion of ſins. For theſe words are found in the tenor of the Inſtitution of it. <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins, Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.24. Now that which ſealeth or confirmeth <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> confirmeth (in the ſence lately declared) the whole Goſpel.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43506:261"/> Nor can theſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſpeaking of the Wine in this Sacrament) <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed; &amp;c.</hi> be reaſonably drawn to any other ſignification, or import, them that he ſhould intend, and deſire, that the Wine, which (according to his Inſtitution, and Command) ſhould be drunk in the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Sacrament, ſhould be as rich, as lively and pregnant a ſecurity, as can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, or deſired, that his blood was very ſoon after, to be ſhed to purchaſe and procure <hi>Ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins</hi> for men. So that Sacraments in reſpect of their Inſtitution, and impoſition on men, are moſt holy and ſolemn engagements upon God to perform unto them, all that he ſignifieth, or profeſſeth in them, or by them, that is, all the great good things promiſed in the Goſpel: So in reſpect of their reception, or ſubmiſſion unto by men, they are moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſevere obligements upon them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto him, what they reciprocally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs by ſuch their ſubjection unto them; that is, conſcienciouſly to endeavour to believe him in all his promiſes and to obey him in all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and commands.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion 12. <hi>From whence have Sacraments that obliging force upon God, which you have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and aſſerted?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> From himſelf, or from his own moſt gracious and free conſent, to condeſcend unto the weakneſs of his poor creature man, upon ſuch terms, as to put himſelf into bonds of his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43506:261"/> own making, unto them, for the performance of all articles on his part mentioned in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between him and them: that ſo they may repoſe themſelves upon him with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſecurity, and eaſe of heart and ſoul, for the receiving of all from him without fail in due time. No creature can diſpoſe of the leaſt mite of his treaſure; but himſelf may do with his own what he pleaſeth (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15.) and conſequently may enrich his creature with what engagements of it ſelf unto it he judgeth meet.</p>
                     <p>Queft. 13. <hi>From whence ariſeth that obliging force, whereof you lately ſpake, which Sacraments have over men?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The obliging force which Sacraments have upon, or over men, to ſtand faſt and cloſe to their holy profeſſion, and to make good the terms of it by ſuitable actions, and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ariſeth partly from the wiſdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and authority of God; partly alſo from men themſelves, and their voluntary ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of themſelves unto them. God, out of his Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hath made it a Law, that they that ſhall come under Sacramental diſpenſations, and ſubmit to the reception, and uſe of them, ſhall hereby become debtors to obſerve and obey the whole Goſpel in all the precepts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of it. But this Law taketh no hold on ſuch perſons, who never accepted, nor ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, any of theſe Ordinances. Therefore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43506:262"/> that they come to have any ſuch obliging force upon men; as that we ſpeak of, proceedeth (at leaſt in part) from their own free conſents to become proſelytes unto them. It is true, as far as importunity, by exhortations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by arguments and motives, on the right hand, and on the left, may be ſaid to compel men; many that are brought to ſubmit unto the uſe of them, may be ſaid to be compelled by God hereunto. But the act, or acts, unto which men are drawn by ſuch compulſion as this, commonly have more of the will in them (and in this reſpect may be ſaid to be more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary) then theſe that proceed from it in a ſpontaneous way, and when it acteth meerly out of its own inclination. As he that hath been by Goſpel arguings, and motives, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to believe, hath (as the ſaying is) more good will on his way, then an unbeliever hath on his; eſpecially if he hath not taken ſome courſe more then ordinary to make him wilful in his way. But this by the way.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 14. <hi>Whether doth God command, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all men, to ſubmit unto his Sacramental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as to be Baptized, and from time to time, upon occaſion, to be preſent at the Lords Supper, and to partake of the adminiſtration?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A thing may be ſaid to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or required of a man in a two-fold ſenſe, or conſideration, either 1. abſolutely, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (as we uſe to ſay) without any more ado, or elſe 2. in a certain order and method,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43506:262"/> and upon a precedency of ſome things (one, or more) and theſe alſo required, to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly capable of doing it Under the Law, the <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to offer gifts and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: yet in caſe any man knew, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that another had taken an offence at him, and was not yet ſatisfied, he was not to offer his gift until he had firſt reconciled (at leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reconcile) himſelf unto him: but this being done, he was to offer it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23, 24. So to pray unto God is a duty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all men: yet if any man be reſolvedly wicked, and turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, he is firſt to relent, or repent, of ſuch a reſolution, and then he is bound to pray, not before or otherwiſe: Such a perſon is bound to pray but in <hi>ſenſu diviſo,</hi> not in <hi>ſenſu compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi> that is he, is bound to forſake his abominable wickedneſs before he prayeth: but he is bound to pray, upon the performance of this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, [<hi>viz.</hi> of forſaking his wickedneſs] which he is bound to perform likewiſe, even before he hath performed it. In the former ſenſe then of the two propounded, God doth not require of all men ſubjection to his Sacramental Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but in the latter he doth. He requireth not of unbelievers, or of perſons wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Goſpel, or ſcandalous or debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their lives and converſations, that whi ſt they continue ſuch, they ſhould have any part or fellowſhip in Sacramental tranſactions: but even whilſt they are ſuch, he doth require of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43506:263"/> them, and command them, that they truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and unfeignedly believe, and then (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially hereunto) that they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to partake of thoſe adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion. 15. <hi>But doth God require of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have repented, and believe, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in his Sacramental Ordinances?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God requireth of all ſuch that they deſpiſe not, that they neglect not theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, nor yet the means, or the doing of thoſe things, without which they cannot order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be admitted to partake in them, by thoſe, with whom the diſpenſation of them is entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and to whom it appertaineth by way of duty, or charge, to take care that all things be done decently, and in order, about, and in the adminiſtration of them.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion. 16. <hi>Who are they, to whom the duty, or charge you ſpeak of, doth appertain, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the diſpenſation of the Sacraments?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every Congregation, or Church-Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Believers, or perſons upon Goſpel grounds, reputed ſuch, together with their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers lawfully choſen, Elders, and Deacons, are put in truſt by <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his Sacraments, and the adminiſtration of them, in, and amongſt their own bodies, or members (reſpectively) and may, <hi>Salvo jure coeli,</hi> keeping to the rule, and orders preſcribed by God in ſuch caſes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whom they pleaſe into their Sacramental Communion; or (to ſpeak more warily) are bound, and ought to admit all thoſe unto this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43506:263"/> their Communion, who ſhall orderly deſire it of them. That ſuch Churches as theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by Chriſt with thoſe holy things of God we ſpeak of (with the ordering of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental concernments, evidently, appeareth from ſeveral paſſages in the two Epiſtles, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtle, to the Church at <hi>Corinth;</hi> and more particularly in the fifth Chapter of the former, and ſeventh of the latter: It is clear from <hi>ver.</hi> 27.12, 13. Of the former of theſe Chapters, that the Body of this Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, (for to this was the Epiſtle written) in tolerating a notorious wicked perſon in their Communion, from which, had they quitted themſelves according to their duty, and charge impoſed on them by God, they had excluded him. Much more might be argued to this point from the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 17. <hi>When, or upon what terms may a perſon (one or more) be ſaid orderly to deſire Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion with a Church of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>not being a Member hereof; and ſo, that his motion, ought not by this Church to be refuſed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> When either ſome of the Members of this Church ſhall teſtifie upon knowledge, that he is a perſon of an honeſt and Chriſtian life and converſation, or elſe that he is a Member of ſome other Church in Goſpel Order, and not under cenſure; or if the ſaid perſon ſhall be recommended by any ſuch Church as this, as being a Member of it; and further, if this perſon (whether he be a member of ſome other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43506:264"/> ſuch Church, or not) having by one means or other, ſatisfied the Church, to which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth, that he is a perſon walking orderly in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, ſhall declare like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto it, that whilſt he ſhall deſire to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or frequent the ſaid Communion with it, he will be content to ſubmit to the Diſcipline and Government thereof; he (I ſay) that ſhall thus, and upon theſe terms deſire Sacramental Communion with any Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may (I conceive) be ſaid to deſire it orderly.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 18. <hi>Why needs, or why ought, a Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>to be thus ſtrictly inquiſitive after the Faith and Manners of thoſe, whom they receive and admit unto their Sacramental Communion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſons hereof are many: I ſhall briefly touch upon, only five, Firſt, the Apoſtles exhortation, or caution, unto <hi>Timothy</hi> (1 Tim. 5.22. in a caſe not altogether unlike) is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in this alſo. <hi>Lay hands</hi> (ſaith he unto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>) <hi>ſuddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens ſins; keep thy ſelf pure,</hi> implying, that they Communicate in the guilt of other mens ſins, who having a lawful power to prevent their ſinning, ſhall not be diligent and careful to uſe it accordingly. Thus <hi>Eli</hi> the High Prieſt was <hi>partaker</hi> of the ſins of his two Sons, and was ſeverely puniſhed by God for it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13, 14. compared with c. 4.18 Yea, the ſaid cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reacheth yet further, involving thoſe in the guilt of <hi>other mens ſins;</hi> not only who neglect to make uſe of that power, which is lawfully
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43506:264"/> veſted in them, to keep thoſe from ſinning, who either they know, or have ground to ſuſpect, that they will ſin, unleſs they uſe their power to prevent it, but even thoſe alſo who ſhall through careleſsneſs or remiſsneſs, ſuffer ſuch perſons to paſs through that door, the key whereof God hath entruſted them with, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, who, for ought they know, or have reaſon to judge otherwiſe, will ſin by the opportunity, or means, of that paſſage to eaſily given them. For in caſe <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould have <hi>laid hands ſuddenly</hi> upon any man, poſſibly this man thus inconſiderately admitted into the Miniſtry, might have quitted himſelf as well, and worthily in this great Office, as another, that ſhould have been admitted with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt caution; yet <hi>Timothy,</hi> even in this caſe, ſhould have neglected the charge given him, and conſequently, incurred the crime of being <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of other mens ſins:</hi> unleſs (haply) we ſhall interpret the clauſe, <hi>neither be partaker of other mens ſins</hi> thus (which I take to be the true meaning of it) and do not run the hazzard, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not thy ſelf to danger, of being involved in the guilt <hi>of other mens ſins.</hi> This expoſition might be cleared, and confirmed, by comparing it with ſundry paſſages of like phraſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but this is not ſo proper here. But (doubtleſs) the minde of God to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the dehortation, or charge mentioned, is alike to all others in caſes of like nature, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now then, inaſmuch as they, who (in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43506:265"/> the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.) <hi>eat and drinks unworthily</hi> [at the Lords Table; and why may there not be the like miſdemeanor committed, and conſequently, the like guilt contracted, in, or about, the other Sacrament alſo?] <hi>eat and drink Judgement</hi> [or damnation] <hi>unto themſelves,</hi> and conſequently, muſt needs ſin, in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at a very grievous rate; thoſe Churches that ſhall <hi>ſuddenly</hi> admit men, or women, unto their Sacramental Communion, or without ſome rational ground of their meetneſs to bear a part in ſo great and holy a Service, having a right of power (as hath been ſaid) veſted in them by God to maintain the reverence and honour of it within their own Community, and conſequently to ſhut the door of admiſſion here againſt all unknown perſons whatſoever, evidently by ſuch a behavior, incur the guilt, or (which amounts to little leſs) expoſe themſelves to the danger, of being <hi>partakers of other mens ſins,</hi> which they cannot do without their own.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the holy things of God muſt needs ſuffer loſs in that reverence and high eſteem, which either they have, or ought to have, in the Souls and Conſciences of men, by being made common, or not managed with a ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of care and circumſpection, and (as it were) with an holy <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> by thoſe that are inſtruſted with the ordering of them. We read that the wickedneſs of the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> being Prieſts, occaſioned men to <hi>abhor the offering of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.17. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43506:265"/> of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that deſigning to bring the Worſhip of God in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> out of requeſt and credit with the people, and to eſtabliſh the Idolatry of his Calves he <hi>made Prieſts of the loweſt of the people, which were not of the Sons of Levi,</hi> I <hi>Kings</hi> 12.31, Yea, after he had been admoniſhed of this his wickedneſs by a Prophet ſent on purpoſe unto him by God, who confirmed his miſſion by a double miracle, the one of Judgement, the other of Mercy, upon his perſon, and by a double Miracle alſo upon his idolotrous Altar, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.4, 5, 6.) it is written thus: <hi>After this thing Jeroboam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not from his evil way, but made again of the loweſt of the people, Prieſts of the high places; WHOEVER WOULD,</hi> he <hi>conſecrated him, and he became one of the Prieſts of the high places. And this thing became ſin to the houſe of Jereboam, even to cut it off, and to deſtroy it from off the face of the earth,</hi> v. 33, 34. From whence this (amongſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other things) is of ready obſervation; that the majeſtick awful &amp; pleaſing reverence which is due unto the holy things of God, by their coming unto unſanctified and undue hands is in danger of being ecclipſed, and falling low in the hearts of men. See and conſider, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. Therefore great care is to be taken by all the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (reſpectively) that, as far as is poſſible, no wicked perſon have the right hand of fellowship given unto him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, in declaring, or <hi>ſhewing forth the Lords Death:</hi> which they have, that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43506:266"/> by them to <hi>eat and drink</hi> at the Lords Table, (as the Apoſtle himſelf interprets this action) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhould endeavour the perfecteſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that may be unto the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (by the very name whereof theſe Churches, at eaſt in their collective body, are frequently ſtiled) or the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which is, <hi>coming down from God out of Heaven</hi> (Rev. 21.2.) Into this, it is expreſly ſaid <hi>that there ſhall IN NO WISE</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Fourthly, Several particulars recorded we find that God, even under the Law, was very jealous over his holy things, that the honor and reverence due unto them might be maintained at their height, and without the leaſt imbezile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by neglect, or prophanation, what by declarations, precepts, and charges given in this kinde, what by exemplary judgements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon tranſgreſſours of theſe precepts, what by proviſions made otherwiſe to prevent all delinquency of that kinde we ſpeak of (I mean, about the ſacred things of his worſhip)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43506:267"/> he hath largely teſtified unto the world, his great zeal to ſecure the honor, and awful eſteem of theſe things, from all indignities and affronts that are otherwiſe like to be put upon them by the ſuperſtition, neglect, or preſumption of men; yea, and his full reſolution to avenge with great ſeverity, the contempt of them, or the violation of thoſe wiſe and holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, or ſignifications of his holy will and pleaſures, which he hath given concerning them, and the uſe of them. Firſt, there were many ſtrict and peremptory charges given by him in this kinde. <hi>I WILL be ſanctified in them that come nigh me,</hi> &amp;c. Lev. 10.3. <hi>Ye SHALL keep my Sabba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, and reverence my Sanctuary,</hi> Lev. 19 30.26.2. <hi>Neither ſhall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Iſrael. LEST YE DIE,</hi> Numb. 18.32. In the former part of this Chapter no leſs penalty then death is threatned both to Prieſts and Levites, and ſtrangers upon their delinquency about holy things. God ſpeaks very frequently in the voice of this thunder in the Books of the Law: We ſhall not need to cite more places.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, neither was God more ſtrict in charging men about the managing and uſing his holy things, then ſevere in his executions upon thoſe that neglected his directions and commands in this kinde. He was ſo far from diſpenſing with the violation of the Sabbath by the poor man that gathered ſticks on this day, that he expreſly commanded that he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43506:267"/> ſhould be <hi>ſtoned to death</hi> (which was eſteemed the heavieſt of all the four kindes of death that were wont to be inflicted on Malefactors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi>) Numb. 15.35. Nor did he ſpare the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf, when they neglected his appointment concerning the fire which they were to offer; and inſtead hereof put <hi>ſtrange, fire upon their Cenſers</hi> [that is, fire which he <hi>had not commanded them</hi> to offer.] It is ſaid, that <hi>there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.</hi> God did terrible execution upon them (as it were) with his own hands, and that ſuddenly, upon their ſinning, not affording them (for ought that appeareth, or is in any degree probable) any time for repentance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.12. So the two Sons of <hi>Eli. Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> for their miſdemeanors about the Sacrifices, and holy things of God, were ſentenced by him <hi>both to dye in one day,</hi> 1 Sam 2 34. Which Sentence was ſoon after put in execution by the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.11. To hear of his ſeverity againſt <hi>Uzzah,</hi> for his miſcarriage, with the circumſtances of it, conſidered, is enough to <hi>make both a mans ears to tingle.</hi> His offence was only the putting forth his hand to ſtay the Ark, being a perſon not commiſſioned by God to meddle with it. Yet 1. He was one of the two that drove the Cart on which it was now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; which might ſeem to require of him ſome care about it. 2. His intention (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) in what he did in the caſe, was good and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43506:268"/> commendable; which was to prevent any hurt, which, as he reaſonably conceived, the Ark was like to receive by being more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſhaken (as it ſeems) by the ſtumbling of the Oxen. 3. Nor is it like that he ſaw any of the Prieſts, who might lawfully have done that for it which he did, near at hand (or at leaſt) offering to do it. And yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the favor of theſe circumſtances, God was ſo jealous over his Ordinances, concerning the Ark, and Prieſthood, that he could not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with leſs then the preſent death of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; although at the ſame time he could not but be highly pleaſed with the zealous devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſervices of <hi>David,</hi> and all the people. <hi>And David and all Iſrael</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>played before God withall their might, and with ſinging, and with harps, and with pſalteries, and with tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets:</hi> and ordinarily times of much ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, diſpoſe both God, and man, not to acts of ſeverity, but of kindeneſs and bounty. Therefore (certainly) God was moſt highly diſpleaſed with the fact of <hi>Uzza,</hi> breaking out upon him in ſo ſore a judgement at ſuch a time, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. Nor did he ſhew himſelf a <hi>reſpecter of perſons,</hi> when he ſmote <hi>Uzziah</hi> the King with the plague of Leproſie (and would not reſtore him until the day of his death) only for preſuming and attempting to do that about the Worſhip of God, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not to him to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43506:268"/> Prieſts (as <hi>viz. to burn Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe</hi>) And it may be a queſtion, whether he did know, at leaſt whether at that time he did remember, that what he would have done, was unlawful for him to do: however he only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and attempted the irregular fact we ſpeak of, but acted it not, being prevented, firſt by the Prieſts who withſtood him in that his attempt, and then by God himſelf, who fell upon him with that ſore judgement of Leproſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had actually perpatrated the ſin, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly (and laſtly for this) God to ſecure the honor and reverence of his holy things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to preſerve them in their purity, appointed a numerous and ſtrong guard about them, to whom it was given in charge to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, and careful that nothing ſhould be done, in one kinde or other, contrary to his minde and pleaſure in his Inſtitution, and appointment of them (reſpectively) we read of <hi>four thouſand Levities</hi> that were appointed as <hi>Porters,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.5. whoſe office and imployment was, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>ſtand at the gates of the houſe of the Lord, that none that was unclean IN ANY THING, ſhould enter in,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.19.21, 22. partly <hi>to overſee the veſſels and all the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oyl, and the frankincenſe, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (with other things appointed for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in the Sanctuary) that is, to take care and ſee that all ſhould be of the right kinds
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43506:269"/> (reſpectively) ſo as to anſwer the commands of God concerning them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.27, 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if God, under the Law, when the Rites and Ordinances about his Worſhip, were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly numerous, was notwithſtanding ſo jealous and tender over them all, that the neglect, contempt, or prophanation of any one of them, cauſed his anger and jealouſie (as we heard) to ſmoke againſt every offender in this kinde; is there not very great cauſe to fear, or (rather) to conclude that now, under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel he will be yet more jealous over thoſe few, wherewith he hath here contnted himſelf in his Worſhip, for the eaſe and accommodation of men? Will he be patient under the careleſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any of theſe, when they who did not reverence his Counſels and appointments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe other, found him (as we heard) a conſuming fire? where great multitudes are, particulars (commonly) are not ſo much min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or regarded, or where the number is but ſmall. Therefore as God plainly told <hi>Aaron,</hi> that <hi>he and his Sons, and his Fathers houſe with him, ſhould bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the iniquity of the Sanctuary, and of their Prieſthood</hi> [meaning, ſhould anſwer for all miſcarriages, in, and about, his holy things, which lay in their power, and within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of their office, to prevent] <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.1. So hath he now laid it upon his Saints, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made <hi>Priests unto him,</hi> (Revel. 1.6.) in their reſpective Bodies and Congregations,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43506:269"/> to <hi>bear the iniquity</hi> of the Holy Ordinances of the Goſpel, and to be accountable unto him for all irregularities about them, whereby, through their negligence, or unfaithfulneſs, they ſhall at any time ſuffer in their purity, and honour.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly (and laſtly) there is little, or (rather) no queſtion to be made, but that the looſeneſs, indifferency, and remiſsneſs in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about the holy things of God intruſted with them, and matters relating unto the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his worſhip have been the deſolation and laying waſte of all thoſe Churches, from whom their Candleſticks have a long time been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and will be of like ſad conſequence (in time) to all thoſe yet remaining, if they ſhall prophane their excellency with the guilt of them. As on the other hand, no inſtance (I believe) can be given of any Church wholly diſſipated, or pluckt up by the roots, but only ſuch, who leaving their firſt love, let looſe the reins of their Diſcipline, and ſo expoſed the holy things of God amongſt them to pollution, and prophanation. Several paſſages in the Epiſtles dated from heaven, and ſent by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> (<hi>Rev. cap.</hi> 2. and <hi>cap.</hi> 3.) ſtand well affected towards ſuch a concluſion. I ſhall inſtance only in this (in the epiſtle to the Church in <hi>Sardis, cap.</hi> 3.23.) <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to dye. — Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43506:270"/> If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come upon thee as a thief,</hi> &amp;c. The condition in the laſt clauſe, <hi>If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come &amp;c.</hi> clearly implieth, that as the neglect of it would certainly e're long bring <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a deſolating judgement upon them, ſo a timely and conſciencious performance of it would be their ſecurity and peace. Now by <hi>watching</hi> (the condition here mentioned) is meant, their conſtant care, and intenſeneſs of minde, to <hi>ſtrenghten the things</hi> which remained [amongſt them] <hi>but were ready to dye;</hi> that is, to put in vigorous and due execution thoſe orders and injunctions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the regulating their Church affairs, and matters relating to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God amongſt them; which though they did not wholly neglect, or caſt aſide, yet they languiſhed, and grew extreamly remiſs in the exerciſe and practiſe of them, and were in a ſhort time likely to give over all. So that it concerns all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, as they prize their Canſtleſticks, and the incomparable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and bleſſing of the preſence of God, and the continuance of his ſaving Ordinances, amongſt them, to preſerve and vindicate the chaſtity and honor of their Sacramental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as far as humane care and diligence are able to promote ſo worthy an undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 19. <hi>But is it not contray to the Law of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Charity to ſuſpect any perſon of unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when we have no ſufficient ground for ſuch a ſuſpition?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:43506:270"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To ſuſpect that a perſon unknown to us, may (poſſibly) be unworthy, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any Law of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Charity: for no man ſtandeth bound by any ſuch Law, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that all men (nor conſequently, that any particular man) unknown to us, have true Faith. For no Law in this kinde obligeth us to believe any thing contrary to what we know. Now if we believe the <hi>faithful witneſs,</hi> and great Prophet of the world, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in that his Doctrine, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> we cannot (lightly) but know, not only that any particular perſon, unknown to us, may (poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) be void of true Faith, but that it is more <hi>probable</hi> that ſo he is: which is a competent ground for ſuſpicion in the caſe. Therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>charity believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.) his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that Charity diſpoſeth, or inclineth, a man to <hi>believe,</hi> and ſo to <hi>hope, all things</hi> [that is, all good things concerning others] which are believable, and hopeable, that is, of the truth, whereof there are reaſonable and competent grounds, though not demonſtrative, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily convincing. For otherwiſe, it is not the <hi>charitable</hi> man, but (as the wiſe man informeth us) <hi>the fool</hi> (or according to our laſt tranſlation) <hi>the ſimple, that believeth every word</hi> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15.), that is, as well that, which is moſt unworthy, as that which is beſt worthy to be believed. Yea the Apoſtle himſelf was jealous of the integrity and ſoundneſs of many, profeſſing Chriſtianity,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43506:271"/> even in his dayes, when this profeſſion ran in a much ſtraiter channel, then now it doth, and was taken up upon a far better, and more ſerious account, by thoſe that profeſſed it, then now it is. <hi>For I am jealous over you,</hi> &amp;c. (ſaith he to the Corinthians) and <hi>I fear leſt by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty; ſo your mindes ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in</hi> Chriſt, 2 Cor. 11.23. See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.11. 2 Cor. 12.20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When our belief, or hope of the goodneſs of another relateth only to our ſelves, ſo that in caſe we be deceived, we alone are like to ſuffer by it, the Law of Charity ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us, that we be ſatisfied with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and teſtimonies, of leſs weight, then when we believe, or hope, in this kinde, for other and more eſpecially for God (I mean when ſuch a belief, or hope, as now I ſpeak of, directly tend in their miſcarriage and fruſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either to the damage of others, or diſhonour of God. I may truſt ſuch a man with a ſumme of money out of a perſwaſion of his honeſty, which I ſhould offend againſt Charity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto another, to be truſted in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by him. But when the Glory of God, or the honor of his holy things, are intereſſed in our belief, or perſwaſion of mens goodneſs, it is ſo far from making any breach upon the Law of Charity, to uſe all diligence and care for our ſatisfaction, that a facility, or over-eaſineſs of belief in the caſe, is like to expoſe us to that

On the other hand, if the perſon deſiring Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion with a Church, be unworthy, this Church by detecting it, and hereupon, denying him that, which would be ſinful, and of ſad conſequence, unto him, ſhall in, and by one and the ſame act, both pleaſe God (as the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did, by diſcovering thoſe to be <hi>lyars, who ſaid they were Apoſtles,</hi> as we lately heard) maintain the honor of his holy things, keep a ſoul from making it felf actually <hi>guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt</hi> (1 Cor. 11.27.) and withal, conſult the honor, peace, and ſafety of themſelves, or their own Church-body.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. 20. <hi>But are not the Sacraments convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinances? If ſo, ought not ſinful men, and unbelievers be admitted to partake of them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It no where appears that God ever intended them for converting Ordinances, nor doth reaſon lead us to conceive of them under ſuch a notion. Or if this ſhould be granted, or ſuppoſed, I mean, that they are converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) yet will it not follow from hence, that therefore ungodly and unbelieving perſons (other then thoſe, that haply may deceive the Church under a plauſible profeſſion of Faith and Holineſs) ſhould be admitted to receive, or to partake of, the elements themſelves in their reſpective adminiſtrations. Preaching of the Goſpel is (without controverſie) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance; yet ought not prophane or unbelieving perſons be admitted, or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to preach the Goſpel in order to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. But as <hi>Faith</hi> (and ſo Converſion) <hi>cometh by hearing</hi> [the Goſpel preached by others, orderly called hereunto, not by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a mans ſelf] ſo may Sacramental Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations be ordained by God, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of men, yet not by their own acting, or bearing a part, in the execution of them, but by being preſent, and beholding, and minding theſe adminiſtrations, whilſt performed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But that God intended not the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men as yet unconverted, by a ſelf-acting in Sacramental diſpenſations, or that theſe by ſuch an interpoſure of the ſaid perſons in, or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43506:273"/> about them, ſhould be any means of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but rather obſtructions in the way thereunto, is fully evident from that of the Apoſtle, where (ſpeaking of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper) he ſaith thus: <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh</hi> [not converſion, or Salvation, but] <hi>damnation unto himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. Doubtleſs an unconverted perſon or unbeliever, cannot <hi>diſcern the Lords Body</hi> [that is, exhibit in any degree that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or thoſe ſacred reſpects unto it, which a Sacramental memorial, or participation, of it requireth of all thoſe, who do partake of it in this Ordinance] and conſequently, cannot but <hi>eat and drink, unworthily,</hi> at the Lords Table (if he eats and drinks here at all.) Other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a demonſtrative eviction of the ſame truth, might be readily drawn from verſe 24, 25, 26. of the ſame Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt many grounds in reaſon that might be inſiſted on to give further light and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to this truth. I ſhall (at preſent) menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only two.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God is not wont to ſet up one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in competition with another; or (which is the ſame) to appoint more then one for the effecting of one and the ſame end (I mean, one and the ſame proper and immediate end: for otherwiſe, all Ordinances are given by him to effect and bring about the ſame general, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, or ultimate ends.) This principle the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43506:273"/> Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth to be a truth, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from it in ſeveral places. <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God: for if righteuoſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> (Gal. 2.21.) implying that God accounteth more wayes, or means of juſtification then one, to be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vain; and conſequently, that if he had ordained, or appointed, one for this purpoſe, he would not have appointed another. He rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth and concludeth from the ſame ground, in the ſame caſe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14.) thus, <hi>For if they which are of the Law, be heirs, Faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect.</hi> So alſo in ſomewhat a different caſe he argueth from the ſame ſuppoſition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11. <hi>If therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection were by the Levitical Prieſthood (for under it the people received the Law) what further need was there that another Prieſt ſhould riſe after the order of Melchiſedeck,</hi> &amp;c. From theſe, and the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of the Apoſtle, it is clear, that when God hath ſufficiently provided for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any benefit, or end, by one means, he never brings another (as it were) over the head of it, but reſolveth, that that which is already, or firſt eſtabliſhed, ſhall (at leaſt, ordinarily) have the honor entire to it ſelf of inveſting men with the benefit, or bleſſing, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, or procurement, whereof it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, and that no corrival, or compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor ſhall be ſet up by it to divide with it. And accordingly the Apoſtle reaſoneth, Gal. 3.21. <hi>For if there had been a Law given, that could have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43506:274"/> given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>David</hi> of old (in another caſe) <hi>Then David ſaid, none ought to carry the Ark of God, but the Levites; for them hath the Lord choſen to carry the Ark of God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Chron. 15.2. Now then it being certain that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive hearing of the Goſpel preached is an Ordinance or means, appointed and ſanctified by God for the work of converſion, it is no wayes conſiſtent with the Counſel of God (lately declared from the Scriptures) to imagine that Sacramental participation ſhould be a means alſo appointed by him for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is true, God may (and ſometimes doth) prepare, diſpoſe, and bring men nearer to converſion, then they were before, by other means, then by the Goſpel preached, even in ſuch places where it is preached, and may be heard: and where it is not preached (I mean, by men) out of his great compaſſion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls of men, he taketh a liberty, though (I believe) ſomewhat ſparingly, to ſubſtitute other means in the place thereof, and worketh converſion by theſe. But where there is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to hear the Goſpel preached by men, I can ill believe the full and through converſion of any perſon without it. But ſecurely confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I am, that there is no other ordinance, or means, deſigned, or aſſigned by God, wherein, or whereby the ſaving converſion of any man ought to be, or reaſonably can be, without this, hoped, or expected. It is not probable
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43506:274"/> (and the ſenſe of ſome of the beſt expoſitors is the ſame) that the converſion of <hi>Paul</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by all that which paſſed between <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and him, on the way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> or until he had heard and learned more of the minde of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from <hi>Ananias;</hi> who, in the judgement of ſome Ancient Writers, was one of the ſeventy Diſciples, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ordained, and ſent forth to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. or, as <hi>Calvin</hi> conceiveth, was upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the preſent viſion, wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto him, made a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is this reaſon evincing the Sacraments not to be converting Ordinances; namely, becauſe perſons unconverted, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, are not regularly capable, no not of that Sacramenct, which is moſt like to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I mean, Baptiſme: This clearly appears from the anſwer, which <hi>Philip</hi> made to the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,</hi> deſiring Baptiſme of him in theſe words, <hi>See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btized? Philip</hi> anſwereth him, if <hi>thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt</hi> (Acts 8 37.) plainly implying that otherwiſe [<hi>viz.</hi> in caſe he did not thus believe] he might not, or ought not [to be Baptized.] This had been a very uncharitable, and unchriſtian anſwer, in caſe he had not ſo believed, if to Baptize him had been ſo much as a probable, or likely means to make him a believer. For to require that of a man, which he hath not, but ſtands in great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43506:275"/> need of, as a condition for the imparting of that unto him, which would ſupply him, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſingenuous and importune, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we may impart ſuch a thing unto him without any trouble, or damage to our ſelves which had been <hi>Philips</hi> caſe in refuſing to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> becauſe of his unbelief (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he had been an unbeliever) if Baptizing him had been a means to heal his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and to turn him unto God by believing. This which hath been argued concerning Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm from the Text lately cited, might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated from ſeveral others, if need were. Concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that perſons un-converted are altogether, as (if not rather more) uncapable of this [and conſequently, that neither can this be looked upon as a converting Ordinance] appears, from the nature, or import of it, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ounſel of God in it, as the Apoſtle deſcribes, whether the one, or the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>The cup of bleſſing, which we bleſs, is it not the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood of Chriſt?</hi> that is, was not the drinking of it inſtituted, ordained, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the <hi>Communion,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have in his <hi>Blood</hi> [that is, in the great benefit of Redemption purchaſed by his <hi>Blood</hi>] ſhould hereby be, both profeſſed and declared by them openly, and likewiſe nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthened, and confirmed in them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly? Therefore they that are duly capable of <hi>drinking this cup,</hi> muſt have <hi>communion in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43506:275"/> Blood of Chriſt</hi> with believers (and conſequently, muſt be converted) before they drink it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in drinking it, they ſhall act hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and make profeſſion of having that, which they have not. Now (doubtleſs) to act hypocritically is no means of converſion: or if it were, then the moſt wicked and Prophane perſons, who ſtand in moſt need of converſion, ought rather to be invited, incouraged, and freely admitted to the drinking of the cup we ſpeak of, then to be debarred, or kept off from the opportunity, or to be caſt out from amongſt thoſe, that orderly drink it, by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication (in caſe they had fellowſhip with them in the buſineſs, before their wickedneſs break out) which yet we know was the Diſcipline of the Primitive Churches injoyned them by the Apoſtles themſelves. This likewiſe plainly evinceth, that the meaning of the words mentioned, <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> (is not as ſome weakly pretend) as if the Apoſtle did imply, that the <hi>Cup</hi> he ſpeaks of was the means of any mans firſt obtaining, or bringing into the <hi>communion of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Such a ſenſe of the words as this, as it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the diſcipline planted (as hath been ſaid) by the Apoſtles, and practiſed, in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches; ſo is it inconſiſtent with the ſcope of the context, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions herein; as might be ſhewed more at large if it were needful, or proper to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43506:276"/> undertaking. Thus then it is as clear as the Sun riſing in his might, both by the light of the Scriptures, and of grounds in reaſon atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, that Sacramental Ordinances are not converting.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 21. <hi>Whether do Sacramental admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations produce any real effects, in, or upon, the hearts and ſouls of men, that do partake of them, or work any real alteration in them?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If anſwer be made in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, according to the manner of ſpeaking here, the effects of Sacramental actions, are, or may be, not ſimply real, but ſometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and excellent. For this frequently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth even miraculous effects to ſuch cauſes, or means; which are of a Sacramental nature. Thus the dividing of the waters of the Red Sea, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſed through o're dry land, is by God himſelf attributed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> his lifting up his Rod, and ſtretching out his hand over it. <hi>But lift thou up thy Rod</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>and ſtretch out thine hand over the Sea, and DIVIDE it,</hi> &amp;c. Exod. 14.16. So likewiſe the reducing of this Sea unto its former courſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had been thus divided, and whilſt <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and all his Hoſt was in the midſt of the Channel of it, is aſcribed unto the ſame cauſe. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, ſtretch out thy hand over the Sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians,</hi> ver. 26.27. In like manner the bringing of water out of a Rock, is promiſed by God unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> their ſpeaking to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43506:276"/> it. <hi>Take the Rod, and gather thou the aſſembly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou and Aaron thy Brother, and ſpeak ye unto the Rock before their eyes, and it ſhall give forth its water, and TH0U SHALT BRING FORTH to them water out of the Rock, &amp;c.</hi> Numb. 20.8. Thus the dividing of the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> through which they paſſed into the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> ſeems in like manner to be aſcribed to the Prieſts bearing the Ark before them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.15, 16. So the falling down flat of the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> to the ſounding of the Trumpets made of Rams Horns by the Prieſts, before the Ark (together with the performance of ſome other like things preſcribed unto them by God, in order to the ſame effect) <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are ſeveral other inſtances of like conſideration in the Scriptures. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11, 12, 13. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.18.19, 26. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14. If God was pleaſed to work ſuch great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effects as theſe, by means that were not natural, or proper by any inherent quality, or vertue, to produce them, but of the ſame, or the like kind, with thoſe, which are ſtrictly and properly Sacramental; it is but reaſonable to conceive, that he worketh, by theſe [I mean, the Sacraments themſelves] all ſuch effects, whether in, and upon, the hearts, and ſouls of men [uſing them aright] or otherwiſe, which were intended by him in their inſtitution, and for the obtaining of which he hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and commanded the uſe of them unto men.</p>

Upon ſuch an account as this, the Apoſtle preſſeth the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> with the remembrance and conſideration of their having been Baptized, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4.) and the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> with their accuſtomed eating and drinking at the Lords Table, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 16. 21. What a man hath openly, and publickly declared himſelf to own, or to conſent unto, by a voluntary ſubmitting unto any Ceremony, or uſage, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known to ſignifie or import as much, he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43506:277"/> is by ſuch a declaration as this the more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſolemnly ingaged to ſtand by and promote, the intereſt of what he hath thus owned; and yet much more to refrain from whatſoever is like to preiudice, or endamage it. And this (queſtionleſs) is the reaſon why ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and entrances into ſeveral Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Societies, are commonly tranſacted with ſome ceremonial, or rite (in one kinde or other) appropriate to each of them (reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) unto which, he that deſires the relation of a Member, or a Brother, in any of them, muſt ſubmit. Yea, in ſome of them, the members are at certain times, and upon occaſion, required to teſtifie their relation unto their Community, by wearing ſuch, or ſuch, diſtinguiſhing habits, or performing ſuch, or ſuch Services, or the like. So that God in his inſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sacramental Rites for thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to ſubmit unto, and exerciſe themſelves in, from time to time, doth that, which in many other caſes he doth likewiſe, that is, in his ſpiritual tranſactions with men, and matters of their eternal ſalvation, applieth himſelf unto them in their own methods, wayes, and cuſtoms, which they practiſe and follow in their civil and ſecular occaſions, and affairs; only in ſome particular caſes avouching himſelf more benign and favourable then they.

Now neither the firſt, nor the laſt of theſe proviſoes, or exceptions, can have place in the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> (and ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43506:278"/> the middle is impertinent, and inconſiderable.) For 1. There is no evil, whereunto this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion renders a man at any time obnoxious, but what by the clear light of the Goſpel he might have foreſeen from the beginning (<hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 27, 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. with others.)

Therefore to take up and proſecute a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſion upon ſuch terms, which render a mans action and engagement in this Kinde the more conſiderable, and matter of more expectance, and diſcourſe, unto the world (which is done, when it is taken up, and purſued with any ſolemnity of Rite, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) is a rational and proper means to make him reſolvedly willing to adhere unto it, and to diſ-incline, or indiſpoſe him to a renouncing of it.</p>

And if there had been nothing of Ceremony, or ritual obſervance, enjoyned in the Goſpel, and to be practiſed by men in the profeſſion of it, it would, in all likelihood, have ben ſuch a ſtumbling block in the way of this people, that few, or none of them would ever have hearkened unto it, or ſubmitted to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of it, yea by what we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the writings of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43506:285"/> that very many of them, even a good time after they had believed, and made open profeſſion of the Goſpel, were much ſubject to qualmes, and ſhaking fits of Conſcience, through the remembrance of their old Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ever and anon looking back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Now the Apoſtle, amongſt other means uſed by him to compoſe and ſettle them, under ſuch diſtempers, remindes them, that even the Goſpel hath its Ceremonies alſo, and particularly ſuch, which anſwer two of the greateſt, and moſt conſiderable in their own Law, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeover;</hi> Baptiſme in the Goſpel, the former, and the Supper of the Lord, the Latter, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 31. <hi>You lately either ſaid, or implied, that God formerly wrought greater and more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects by cauſes, or means of a Sacramental nature, then he was wont to work by thoſe that are natural, proportioned to their effects. What then may be the reaſon why he worketh at ſo low a rate by Sacraments themſelves, as (it ſeemeth) he doth, thoſe who partake of them ſeldom finding any great, or ſenſible effect of them, or benefit by them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it is to be conſidered, that thoſe Sacramental cauſes, by which God wrought the miraculous effects mentioned, were taken up, and uſed by him only once, and in reference to thoſe particular ends, or effects, reſpectively produced by them. Whereas the Sacraments themſelves are intended by him for ſtanding,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43506:285"/> conſtant, and ordinary cauſes, and means, in the Church; and ſo in this reſpect, are of like conſideration with cauſes and means that are natural. So that as ſuch natural cauſes, whoſe property is to work ſoftly, ſilently and in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way, do not produce their effects with a bluſter, or with much obſervation, although, under their proper and due applications, they work conſtantly in their way: in like manner, God by the Sacraments may work at a good rate of efficacy and power, in and upon, thoſe who regularly and duly partake in their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, although the effects wrought by them, be not conſpicuous, or eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no not by him, in whom they are wrought, at leaſt for a time (whereof ſome account may be given upon another queſtion.) The effect of the Sacraments (in conjunction with other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or means) is ſpiritual growth, as in Grace, in Faith, in Love, in Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now growth in Nature is not at all diſcernable, or percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the motion, progreſs, or in every diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or degree of it, when, or as ſoon as it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but only after ſome ſpace of time, and when many degrees have ſucceſſively advanced, and brought it forward. No perſon ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned, or felt himſelf growing, but only that he had grown.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the leaſt increaſe of Grace, Faith, Holineſs, or of any thing that is ſaving in the ſoul, is a greater and more conſiderable effect, then the removing of Mountains, or then any
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43506:286"/> of thoſe miraculous productions, which we found aſcribed in the Scriptures unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſes mentioned. So that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in excellency of working, or greatneſs of effects, come not behinde any of thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental cauſes, which the Scripture (as we heard) honoureth with thoſe great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful performances ſpecified.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is in my eye to a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree probable, that the counſel and deſign of God in working at the high rate of efficacy and power, in and by Sacramental cauſes, which the Scriptures record (as was lately ſignified) was to bring his Sacraments into the greater eſteem, and higher reſpects with men; and to inſinuate unto them, that in a regular and diligent uſe of them, they may confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him great and gracious things to be wrought in them, and for them. For as he that hath injured one, hath (as the Civil Law ſaith) threatned many: So God, having once, and again, and ten times over, done great things for men uſing ſuch, or ſuch a kinde of means, which he appointed and directed them to uſe, hath hereby [<hi>conſtructively</hi>] promiſed that he will do great things for all thoſe who ſhall duly uſe the like means appointed by him. Our Saviour himſelf argueth upon ſuch a principle as this, and ſtrengtheneth the hand of men to pray upon rationality of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7, 8.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, for men to come to Sacramental adminiſtrations with an erroneous opinion, or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43506:286"/> conceit of the Ordinances, as when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them, either above, or beneath, what is meet, and agreeable to the Counſel of God in them, as well the one, as the other of theſe, may render their communications in them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and fruitleſs. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (as it ſeems) judged it prejudicial to the ſucceſs of his Miniſtry, as well to be over-valued, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, by thoſe that were to hear him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6.11.11.5.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired ſuch a ſteady eſteem with men, which might juſtly and adequately anſwer than worth (that is, thoſe gifts and graces of God) in him, whereof he gave a ſufficient account in his Life and Miniſtry, together with the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Office and work, whereunto he had been called by God. In like manner, if men ſhall expect greater things from the Sacraments then they are able, or then ever God intended them, to perform, as that they ſhould commend them unto God, or work Grace in them <hi>ex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re operato</hi> (as the dreaming Papiſt fancieth) that is, by the bare, or meer receiving them, how unworthily or unpreparedly ſoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is like to render the participation of them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty and void; unleſs it be of an imaginary and windy conceit that God reſpecteth them the more for their partaking of them, even upon ſuch terms; a conceit much like unto that of <hi>Micah,</hi> who was very confident that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>God would do him good,</hi> becauſe he had gotten <hi>A Levite to be his Prieſt,</hi> for the ſervice of his Idols, <hi>Judges</hi> 17.13. So alſo on the other
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43506:287"/> hand, if men ſhall ſin againſt the Sacred worth and Dignity of the Sacraments, by a common and mean eſteem of them, coming unto their adminiſtrations rather of courſe and cuſtom, then out of any raiſed expectation of reaping any ſpiritual bleſſing from them: this likewiſe portends a barren and fruitleſs participation of them; even as <hi>Michals</hi> deſpiſing <hi>David</hi> for dancing before the Ark, is obſerved by the Holy Ghoſt to have been the cauſe of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual barrenneſs; <hi>THEREFORE Michal the daughter of Saul, had no child until the day of her death,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23. The reaſon why an irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and incongruous eſteem of opinion of the Sacraments, as well on the right hand as on the left, render them unprofitable unto thoſe, who under ſuch miſapprehenſions come unto them, may be, becauſe God (as the wiſe man inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>taketh no pleaſure in fools</hi> [that is, in perſons who neglect either to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and improve their underſtandings for the knowledge of the truth of things, or to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the import, and rational ducture of it, being known.] Now then the exerciſe, or exertion of the beneficial vertue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs of the Sacraments, depending wholly upon the Counſel of the Will of God, there is no ground to think that they ſhould do any great thing for thoſe, in whom he taketh no pleaſure [that is, whom he is no wayes inclined to ſhew more then ordinary favor unto] of which kinde of perſons are thoſe (as hath been intimated) who are (whether through careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43506:287"/> and ſloth, are through any unworthineſs otherwiſe) ignorant of the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the Counſel and Deſign of God in them. It is ſaid, that the Lord <hi>Chriſt could do no mighty work in his</hi> own Country, <hi>becauſe of their unbelief, Matth.</hi> 13.58. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5, 6. Now ignorance and unbelief are very near of kin (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.) and when vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily contracted, or perſiſted in, as well the one as the other, diſableth the hand of God (in Scripture notion) from putting forth it ſelf to do things that are excellent for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. Beſides, if God ſhould cauſe his Sacraments to give out their ſtrength unto thoſe, that come unto them with erroneous and falſe perſwaſions concerning them, he ſhould ſeem to comply with them in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and to ſtrengthen and harden them in the way of it. Yea and further, by means of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering their ſouls under it in their Sacramental ingagements, to invite and draw others into the ſame ſnare with them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, An unworthy frame of heart at the time of our drawing near unto or converſing with God in his Sacraments, unſuitable to their nature in reſpect of the holineſs, and ſpiritual ſolemnity and weightineſs hereof, preſenteth us before God, not only uncapable of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or bleſſing from them, but as preparedly obnoxious to ſuch impreſſions, or effects, of his diſpleaſure, which will render us two-fold more the children of death, or condemnation,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43506:288"/> then we were before, or otherwiſe ſhould have been. This the Scripture plainly declareth in the caſe of the Lords Supper: <hi>For he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation</hi> [or judgement] <hi>unto himſelf, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body;</hi> [that is, becauſe in this eating and drinking he doth not by an holy and thankful frame of heart, and an outward deportment ſuitable, acknowledge and give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto the tranſcendent Worth and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this being the proper end and intent, at leaſt one ſpecial end of that ſolemn action, or ſervice, wherein he is now engaged] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. There is a like conſideration of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, whether we be the receivers of it by being at preſent our ſelves to be Baptized, or whether we be only preſent at the adminiſtration of it made unto others. For the highly-adorable Grace of God in the remiſſion of ſins, is held forth, and parabolically acted, or tranſacted, in this Sacrament: in reſpect whereof it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a behavior both inward and outward, anſwerable in reverence and thankfulneſs to the ineſtimable worth, and adorableneſs of it, of thoſe that expect or deſire benefit by it; as they may, not only unto whom, but in the preſence of whom the adminiſtration of it ſhall be duly made at any time. God doth not ordinarily (if at all) either begin, or carry on, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any ſaving work in any man, but only where he findeth his ſubject, equitably prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43506:288"/> or regularly and rationally capable of ſuch a gracious and worthy application unto it, and where he meeteth with any perſon thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and capable, he never faileth to anſwer ſuch his preparations, or to fill his capacity. <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſhua</hi> unto the people) <hi>for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you,</hi> [meaning, if you ſhall <hi>ſanctifie</hi> and prepare your ſelves for ſuch his appearing among you] <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3.5. The Scripture is full of the notion of this truth.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly (and laſtly) When the Sacraments are corruptly adminiſtred, not according to Divine preſcription, the tenor of their (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective) inſtitutions, or will of their Founder, but either with forms of humane device, or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious impoſitions of men, or with the omiſſion or neglect of any ſpecial caution, or direction about them, impoſed by God; any of theſe irregularities (I ſay) and much more, more, or all of them, found in any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental adminiſtration, may cauſe God to take no pleaſure in it, or to refuſe to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with it, and ſo render it as a dead Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, without life or ſoul, unto thoſe that partake of it. For any addition unto, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction from, any ordinance, or command of his deſtroyes the property of its relation unto him, and cauſeth him to look upon it as none of his, according to theſe declarations of his minde in this behalf: <hi>Ye ſhall not adde unto the word that I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43506:289"/> ought from it, that you may keep the commandment of the Lord your God, which I command you</hi> [clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying, that they which either adde any thing unto, or diminiſh ought from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or ordinance of his, alter the property of it, and make it no longer his, but their own] <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. So again, <hi>What thing ſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, obſerve to do it: thou ſhalt not adde thereto, nor diminiſh from it</hi>] meaning, that if they ſhould either adde to it, or diminiſh from it, they ſhould not obſerve, or do, the thing which he commandeth] <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. Now then it is no wayes like that God ſhould bleſs ſtrange Ordinances, or ſuch which he cannot own or acknowledge for his, with the ſame, or the like bleſſing, wherewith he honoreth his own, and thereby ſealeth and confirmeth them for his own. It is much more like that he ſhould curſe, then bleſs, ſuch ordinances of men, which obtrude themſelves in the name and place of his; and conſequently, that they ſhould edifie men rather to deſtruction, then ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 32. <hi>What may be the reaſon, why many, yea, the greateſt part of thoſe, whom we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably but judge do reap benefit by Sacramental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, are yet little ſenſible of any benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them in this kinde?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two reaſons hereof were inſinuated about the beginning of the Anſwer to the next preceding queſtion. One was becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and chief benefit of our converſing with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43506:289"/> God, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Sacraments, is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and inward growth, or the nouriſhing, or battleing of the new man, or <hi>hidden man of the heart</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaketh.) Now growth (generally) or rather growing, that is, the motion or progreſs in growth, is like the moving of the ſhadow, which the ſtyle, or cock, projecteth upon a Sun-Dial; the motion whereof, by reaſon of the leaſurableneſs or flowneſs of it, is imperceptible: only after ſome competent advancement, and progreſs of it, it may be perceived that it hath moved. Such is the nature and property of augmentation from an inward principle, which we call growth; it is diſcernable, not as in making, but as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been made. And as we are little ſenſible that our young children being daily preſent with us, increaſe in ſtature, till after ſome conſiderable time, or by making tryal by ſome mark, or meaſure: ſo is the ſpiritual growth of the inner man the leſs diſcernable, becauſe we are ever and anon looking upon it, and this with a curſory and little obſervant eye, few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make an exact, or ſatisfactory expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment in the caſe, and fewer willing to beſtow ſo much time and pains in making this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it requireth. Another reaſon why the benefit, or bleſſing, accruſing unto men upon their attendance on God in his Sacraments, is not ſo ſenſible unto them, may be this; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe when an effect ariſeth from a plurality of cauſes joyntly operating and contributing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43506:290"/> towards the production of it, it is very hard (at leaſt in moſt caſes) to aſſign unto every of theſe cauſes their proper efficiency, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what it is, that is ſeverally, and apart afforded by them towards the raiſing of it. As for example, the health or ſtrength of the body is the effect of meats, and drinks, and ſleep, and exerciſe; as alſo of all thoſe natural faculties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in ſeveral members, or parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which act joyntly with theſe, though ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, towards the one, and the other, of theſe effects. But now, how few are there ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the ſecret and myſterious wayes of nature, as to be able, eſpecially on the ſudden, or without ſtudy and much intenſe ſpeculation, to determine, what every of the ſaid cauſes, ſeverally and appropriately confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth towards either of the mentioned effects. In like manner there being a great variety of cauſes, or means, by the co-efficiency and co-working of which, ſpiritual growth, edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or increaſe in grace are produced in the ſoul; as reading, hearing, meditating of the Goſpel, or Word of God, Communion of Saints, Prayer, Sacraments, minding and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providences in the world, communing with our own hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is no eaſie matter to be clearly ſenſible what it is, which the Sacraments in particular caſt into this treaſury; as <hi>Peter</hi> thought it was a ſtrange queſtion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ask <hi>who touched</hi> him, when great multitudes of people thronged him on every ſide. This
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43506:290"/> (briefly) for the latter reaſon why we are, for the moſt part, little ſenſible of the good we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Sacraments though it be much.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 33. <hi>How many Sacraments are there?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Only two (properly ſo called, as was formerly intimated) <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord. As for the five which the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> addeth unto theſe, they are only ſuch (I mean, Sacraments) in the general ſignification of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> as it ſignifieth either a ſign, or pledge, of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is holy, or elſe ſomething in matters appertaining unto God, that is in ſome degree myſterious, or remote from common appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion (for in both theſe ſignifications the word is ſometimes uſed in the writings of the ancient Fathers, as well as to ſignifie a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly and ſtrictly ſo called.)</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 34. <hi>Why are not the other five, accounted Sacraments by the Papiſts, as well as Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, as truly and properly Sacraments as they?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe their inſtitutions, or reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive precepts upon which they are built, are not Sacramental, as thoſe of <hi>Baptiſme and the Lords Supper</hi> are on all hands acknowledged to be. A Sacramental inſtitution requireth theſe things. 1. Something that is elementary, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and viſible, uſually called the matter of the Sacrament. 2. Some ſpiritual good thing, which is inviſible, ſignified by the other: this ſome call <hi>rem Sacramenti</hi> [meaning (I conceive)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43506:291"/> the thing intended, either to be exhibited and given, or elſe to be ratified and confirmed, in, or by the Sacrament.] 3. Some proportion, or reſemblance between theſe two [I mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which is natural and viſible, and that which is ſpiritual and inviſible.] 4. An exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action, or ſomething to be outwardly done, whereby the elementary part, or matter of the Sacrament is exhibited, or applied unto men. 5. (and laſtly) A form of words of a Divine preſcription, wherein as well the ſaid propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or reſemblance, between the elementary and ſpiritual parts of the Sacrament, is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as alſo the ſaid applicatory action direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enjoyned. All theſe particulars are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be found in the reſpective inſtitutions of Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper: but the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician Rabbies</hi> are not able to produce an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of any of their five ſuperadded Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of like Character with them. Yea, their Inſtitutions have all of them ſo little of the face, or feature, of that which is confeſſedly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, that the pretenders have more to do, then they can perform, in ſatisfying one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, where it is beſt for them, and leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to ſay, that they are to be found. For 1. As touching Confirmation, their greateſt Clerks cannot agree about the inſtitution of it, as neither when, nor by whom, it was inſtituted; as whether by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either before, or after, his reſurrection (for ſome there are that teach the one of theſe, and ſome the other)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43506:291"/> or whether by his Apoſtles, or whether by ſome Council (for ſome have affirmed the one of theſe alſo, and others, the other) but no marvel (is it) if they agree no better about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this imaginary Sacrament, when as the Scriptures, which any one party of them fancieth and inſiſteth on, for proof of this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are ſo ſcant, impertinent, and irrelative to their purpoſe, that their arguing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding from them, are broadly obnoxious to the fancies, yea, to the reaſons, and judgements of others of their own. But the opinion, that either this, or any other Sacrament, ſhould be inſtituted by any Council, one, or more, is (it ſeems) now generally antiquated amongſt them, it being the current Doctrine of this Church, that the inſtitution of Sacraments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth, prerogative-wiſe, unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> only. So 2. for their Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution hereof (in a Sacramental notion, or conſideration) is ſo far to ſeek, that ſome of their Doctors run one way, and ſome another, to finde it: and that which the moſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, and withal, the moſt diligent ſeekers, amongſt them, do (upon this account) finde, doth not ſatisfie many of their fellows; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (indeed) nothing more in it of any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto a Sacramental Inſtitution, then is to be found in every precept, or command with a promiſe annexed. Beſides, if Penance, or Repentance be a Sacrament, it muſt be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Old Teſtament, rather then of the

Concerning the third of their five ſupernumerary Sacraments, <hi>Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> neither hath this ſo much as an hairs breadth of Sacramental ground in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Yea, that place, <hi>James</hi> 5.14, 15. in which, as in a glaſs, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (with others of his perſwaſion) ſtrongly imagine that they ſee the <hi>Unction</hi> we ſpeak of, compleatly dreſt up by the Holy Ghoſt in Sacramental Habiliments, and thus ſet forth and commended unto the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world. <hi>Caſetan</hi> (another Cardinal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the ſame Church, no whit inferior in parts and learning unto him) upon better grounds, carrieth another way, clearly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing from ſeveral particulars in the words, that there is no inſtitution of any ſuch Sacrament lodged there. It is much more worthy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether that <hi>anointing of the Sick with Oyl,</hi> by the Elders of the Church, praying like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe over them, which the Apoſtle there advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto, ought not, or at leaſt might not, with the deſirable ſucceſs here mentioned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe-wiſe, be at this day practiſed in the Churchs of the Saints. There are ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of no eaſie ſolution, ſtrongly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this way. And 4. For that of their five by Sacraments, which they call, <hi>Order,</hi> or (as ſome of them, who pretend to a more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43506:292"/> exactneſs in ſpeaking, then their Fellows, had rather call it) <hi>Ordination;</hi> neither is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or Appointment of this by <hi>Chriſt</hi> any whit more Sacramental, then of the former. For if <hi>Ordination</hi> be a Sacrament, there being ſeveral kindes of Ordination eſpecially diſtinct, as the Ordination of Apoſtles, of Prophets, of Evangeliſts, of Paſtors, and Teachers, of Deacons (for we hear nothing of any Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops, as of a Superior degree unto, or of a diſtinct Office from, Presbyters, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers, made, or appointed by <hi>Chriſt</hi>) there muſt in reaſon be as many diſtinct kinde of Sacraments, beſides the other ſix, as there are diſtinct kindes of Ordination: and ſo the ſeven will be multiplyed unto a Bakers Dozen. Beſides, if Ordination were a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why ſhould it not be a Sacrament of the Old Teſtament, as well as, or rather, then of the New, conſidering that the firſt Inſtitution of it was under that? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.8.3. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there is no proportion, or ſimilitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the matter of this ſuppoſed Sacrament (whatever it be deemed to be, hands, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands) and the ſpiritual Grace exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited herein, whether this be a right, or a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power, publickly to teach, or whether it be an inward ability, or gift, for the work of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor is there in any Inſtitution of it any Word of God to be found, which declareth, or intimateth, any ſuch Analogy, or reſemblance, between them; and conſequently, it can be no
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43506:293"/> more then only a Sacrament falſly ſo called. For concerning the former of theſe, the ſaying of <hi>Auſtine, Si Sacramenta quandam, ſimilitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem earum rerum, quarum Sacramenta ſunt, non haberent omninò Sacramenta non eſſent,</hi> (often ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with approbation, by Divines of both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions) is poſitive and expreſs: <hi>If Sacraments</hi> [he means, in reſpect of that which is elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or viſible in them] <hi>have not ſome kinde of ſimilitude with thoſe things, of which they are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they could in no wiſe be Sacraments at all.</hi> 5. (And laſtly) By what cords of reaſon <hi>Matrimony</hi> (of all the reſt) ſhould be drawn into the number of Sacraments, eſpecially of Sacraments of the New Teſtament, where there is no Inſtitution of it at all (for of the Old Teſtament, where the Inſtitution of it is found, it was never, I ſuppoſe, reputed a Sacrament by any) requires a very comprehenſive fancy to imagine. For is a man of an ordinary <hi>genius</hi> able to conceive that ſo many metaphyſical Diſputants, who take upon them to be maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould reaſon thus: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking concerning the relation between <hi>Chriſt, and the Church,</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is a great myſtery.</hi> Therefore <hi>Matrimony</hi> is a Sacrament? Or is not this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Apoſtle (extant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32) only upon an occaſional mention of the conjugal tye preceding, the beſt Sanctuary they have, to ſave their Doctrine of a Matrimonial Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of the hand of thoſe that oppoſe it? And if Matrimony be a Sacrament, why do
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43506:293"/> they judge it as an unclean and unholy thing for their holy perſons, their Prieſts, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men, and all of both Sexes, whom they have tempted into a profeſſion of any of thoſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Orders (by themſelves called, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>) amongſt them, to partake of it? Are not all Sacraments Pearls of the Goſpel? And are the Religious Votaries in the Romiſh Church, all of them (in our Saviours Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6.) either <hi>Swine,</hi> before whom theſe <hi>Pearls</hi> are not <hi>to be caſt;</hi> or <hi>Dogs,</hi> to whom theſe <hi>holy things are not to be given?</hi> But there are too many inconſiſtencies (and theſe palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and broad) between Matrimony, and the nature of a Sacrament, to be ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here. So that the Sacraments (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called) under the New Teſtament, exceed not the number of two, which are Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43506:294"/> acted contrary to the rule, or charge given unto them by Chriſt concerning Baptizing, but rather that they only abridged, or contracted it into a narrower compaſs, without diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or omitting any thing of the juſt import, or meaning of it; and this by the direction and guidance of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to inſtruct us, that forms of words are not to be rigorouſly urged, where ſubſtance of matter is ſufficiently expreſſed. Or elſe it may be ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the words mentioned, <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. did not intend to preſcribe unto them any certain, or ſet form of words to be alwayes uſed, in the act, or at the time of Baptizing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to inſtruct them how they ſhould declare the Doctrine of that Baptiſme, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to adminiſter; as namely, that the precept, or injunction of it, proceeded joyntly from all the three Perſons in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that with this intent, or for this end, that they who believe the Goſpel, ſhould, they and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, over whom they have power, ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and receive it, and by it, be, and openly declared to be, delivered up unto the care and Government of all the Three. This, or the like Doctrine, the Apoſtles might teach, and declare, when any perſon was to be Baptized by them, or by their order, although in the act of Baptizing there was mention made of the name of one of the Three only. Or elſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43506:295"/> (3d. and laſtly) it may be ſaid, that a perſon may properly enough be ſaid to be <hi>Baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>in terminis,</hi> or in words, he be <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> only, becauſe the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> unto which, upon the account of his Baptiſme, in his Name, he is to hearken and ſubject himſelf, plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth the ſame Nature, Dignity, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the other two, with his own. And one ſpecial reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not preſcribe the adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in his own name only, although the adminiſtration performed in his Name alone, be regular enough, and Apoſtolical (as was declared in the queſtion) may be this; that upon ſo ſolemn an occaſion as the Doctrine of the adminiſtration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, he might not omit to declare himſelf as zealous a remembrancer, and aſſertor of the Divine Glory of his Father, and of his Spirit, as of his own. Of his care and zeal in this kinde, we have many other great teſtimonies in the Goſpel. But though <hi>Baptiſme</hi> adminiſtered in the name of <hi>Jeſsus Chriſt</hi> alone (I mean, without mention of the names of the other two in the act it ſelf of adminiſtration) be (as hath been ſaid) authentique, and valid: yet (doubtleſs) the cuſtom of thoſe Churches,: which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Repentance, importing unfeigned grief of Soul for ſin committed, and herein a real hatred of ſin, whereby it is ſeparated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to a diſtance from the ſoul; ſo that the perſon repenting, hereby becomes inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritually clean, is more ſignificantly held forth by the Sacramental action of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43506:296"/> with water, then Faith. For though it be the nature of Faith alſo to <hi>purifie</hi> and cleanſe the heart, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.9. Yet 1. This property of it, is not imported in the ſignification of the word, as it is in that of <hi>Repentance.</hi> 2. It is ſaid to <hi>purifie</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> the conſcience, or ſoul] immediately and directly, rather from the guilt, then from the corruption or defilement of ſin: from theſe, it <hi>purifieth</hi> rather conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, and by the mediation of, <hi>hope,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle <hi>John: And every man that hath this hope in him, PURIFIETH himſelf, even as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3. Or elſe 2. The reaſon of what you ask, may be, to give notice beforehand unto all that deſire to enter upon the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or of the Goſpel, that there is no good to be done upon, no earnings to be made of this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without <hi>Repentance.</hi> and that no Faith, other then what is accompanied with this, is available unto Salvation. The calling of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme <hi>the Baptiſme of Repentance,</hi> is (as it were) to write over the door, by which men are to enter into a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſion: Let no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enter here, who is not fully reſolved to forſake all his former vain and ſinful wayes. Or 3 (and laſtly) Becauſe Repentance, in the comprehenſive and full ſignification of the word [that is, as it includes our ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will and pleaſure of God in all things concerning us, or the practice of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, together with ſorrow and brokenneſs of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43506:297"/> heart for ſins paſt, and full purpoſe of ſoul to refrain our ſelves from them, and from all their fellows for ever] is the general and main ſcope, and end, of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſion, and ſo intended by God himſelf: whereas Faith is only a principle, or a means (and intended by God for none other) to render us duly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this end. As when a man deſireth grapes, or any other conveniency, which he knoweth the Vine to be moſt proper to afford, he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it accordingly; the Vine it ſelf is not the end why he planteth it, nor yet the growing of it in his Soyle, but the benefit or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in one kinde or other, which he knows that ſuch a Plant naturally yieldeth. So God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bring his creature man, to ſuch an happy eſtate, wherein he <hi>might ſerve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of his life</hi> (Luke 1.74, 75.) and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch a Faith in himſelf, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of men in the Goſpel, is by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vertue and property of it, efficacious hereunto, he hath made proviſion accordingly to work, and raiſe it in their hearts and ſouls, not as if the planting of this Faith in them were his primary intendment in the Goſpel, but becauſe in the nature and conſtitution of it (as was ſignified) it hath an effectual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to produce that in their lives and converſations, which he more principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth. Now then, Repentance [in the compleat ſenſe of the word, lately declared]
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43506:297"/> and not Faith importing the great end of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Engagement, or profeſſion, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, or a ſubmiſſion unto Baptiſme, being the entrance upon, or beginning of, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it muſt needs be more oppoſite and proper, to call it the <hi>Baptiſme of Repentance,</hi> then the Baptiſme of Faith; becauſe the end of a thing, or of an engagement or underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is rather to be repreſented to the minde at our entrance upon it, then any particular means relating to this end. It is a common ſaying, <hi>Sapiens debet incipere à fine,</hi> A wiſe man ſhould begin at his end: the meaning is, that he ſhould throughly conſider the nature, and conſequence of his end, before he engageth in the proſecution of it.</p>

The phraſe of ſpeech, wherin Baptiſme is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>The Baptiſme of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> is ſomewhat of a like Character with that of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> unto <hi>Joaſh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning the arrow which he now ſhot by the Prophets direction, out of the window, <hi>And he ſaid, The arrow of the Lords deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> (2 Kings 13.17,) meaning that God by that <hi>Arrow,</hi> ſhot by the King according as he had ordered his Prophet to direct him, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto, and aſſured, as by a ſign from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both this King and his people, that they ſhould be delivered out of the hand of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> In like manner, when the Holy Ghoſt ſtileth, or deſcribeth <hi>Baptiſme</hi> thus; <hi>The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> his meaning (queſtionleſs) is this (or to this effect) that God hath ſanctified, or ſet apart the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rite, or Ceremony of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43506:298"/> give aſſurance unto his Church and people more eſpecially (and in general, unto all the world) that upon an unfeigned and true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> they ſhall every perſon, and ſoul of them, obtain the pardon of all their ſins; much after the ſame manner, as he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated his <hi>bow in the Cloud</hi> (Gen. 9.13.) to be <hi>a token of the Covenant</hi> between him, and men (with every other living creature) <hi>that the waters ſhall become a flood no more to deſtroy all fleſh,</hi> Gen, 9.13.15. This, or the like to be the undoubted ſenſe of the words mentioned [<hi>The Baptiſme of Repentance for, &amp;c.</hi>] may, with evidence enough be evinced, from the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine concerning <hi>Circumciſien,</hi> which was the Sacramental predeceſſor unto <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and inſtituted by God himſelf, upon the ſame, or like account with it, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame or like ſervice in, and to, the Church. <hi>And he</hi> [Abraham] <hi>received the ſign of Circumciſion, a Seal</hi> [that is, for or as, a <hi>ſeal</hi>] <hi>of the righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had yet being uncircumciſed</hi> (Rom. 4.11.) Firſt, <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith</hi> [that is, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto Faith, or thoſe that believe] whereof <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was, in the inſtitution of it, intended by God for a <hi>ſeal,</hi> was, and is, the very ſelf-ſame thing, with <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> or (which is the ſame with theſe) the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin; as the Apoſtle, towards the beginning of this Chapter, had expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Prophet <hi>David.</hi> Now <hi>the ſigne of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43506:299"/> Circumciſion</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>received by Abraham</hi> [as, or for] <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> [that is, of a true and unfeigned Faith, Faith of the ſame kinde with that, which was found in himſelf, whilſt <hi>he was yet uncircumciſed,</hi> and by which he was juſtified, or made <hi>righteous</hi> before God] becauſe it was intended by God in the inſtitution of it, for a confirmatory or ſecuring pledge, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever truly believed in him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, ſhould be juſtified hereby, or made righteous, or (which is the ſame, as was lately ſaid) ſhould obtain <hi>remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Therefore <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in place, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in the Church of God, cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably but be looked upon as intended by him for a <hi>Seal</hi> likewiſe of the ſame great benefit or bleſſing (for greater there is none) to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on men by him upon the ſame, or the like terms. For the Covenant of Grace was alwayes, for ſubſtance, one and the ſame (though differently managed under the Law, and under the Goſpel, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or manifold wiſdom of God) and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, maketh no difference in the terms of this Covenant to be performed by men, as well the one, as the other, having the ſame promiſes, and being equally required of them under both the ſaid diſpenſations of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is no whit more reaſon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43506:299"/> (if ſo much) to conceive that Baptiſme ſhould procure, or contribute any thing towards the procurement of <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> then that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> ſhould, in the dayes thereof, have procured, or wrought ſomewhat towards the procurement of, <hi>the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> which is the ſame (as was lately ſhewed) with remiſſion of ſins. But the Apoſtles Doctrine in the context before us, is clearly this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was inveſted with <hi>the righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> before he was <hi>circumciſed;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that <hi>circumciſion</hi> did not procure it, or act any thing towards the procurement of it, but was only a <hi>Seal,</hi> or confirmation of it, being already obtained. Therefore neither is <hi>Baptiſme</hi> any procuring cauſe, or means, of <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> but only an inſuring pledge from God that by, and upon <hi>Repentance,</hi> it hath been [namely, in caſe men have <hi>repented</hi> before Baptiſme] or elſe ſhall be, obtained by, or upon their <hi>repenting</hi> afterwards, in caſe they ſhall repent. Notwithſtanding even from hence it appeareth, that in ſome caſes, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may, in a kinde of remote ſenſe, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the obtaining of Remiſſion of ſins; as namely in ſuch a ſenſe, in which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, in the Primitive times, did ſometimes operate and contribute towards the obtaining of the ſame bleſſing. This they did, by awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prevailing with ſome to believe the Goſpel preached unto them by thoſe, who wrought them; by means of, and upon which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43506:300"/> believing, they had the bleſſing of <hi>remiſſion of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> conferred upon them by God. So Baptiſme being preached unto men, who have not yet repented, as a pledge or ſigne from God to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, that upon their repentance, the great bleſſing of <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> ſhall come upon them, they may hereby be admoniſhed, and perſwaded, to <hi>repent,</hi> and ſo upon their <hi>repentance,</hi> come to have part and fellowſhip in the ineſtimable priviledge of <hi>remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. 41. <hi>But if</hi> remiſſion of ſins <hi>can no otherwiſe, or in no nearer-hand ſenſe, then that you have now declared, be aſcribed unto</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>how ſhall we underſtand thoſe Scriptures, which ſeem to promiſe this great priviledge unto it in a more plain and direct way? As,</hi> Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, &amp;c. Acts 2.38. <hi>Here the promiſe of</hi> remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins <hi>is made to Baptiſme, as well as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and ſo of</hi> Salvation, <hi>as well as unto</hi> Faith, <hi>or</hi> Believing, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Again,</hi> And now why tarrieſt thou? Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, calling, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>In this Text, Baptiſme alone ſeems to be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to</hi> remiſſion <hi>of ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Although Baptiſme be joyned with Repentance in the ſame exhortation, unto the obedience whereof <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> is (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) promiſed; yet it doth not follow from hence, that the obtaining of the bleſſing here
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43506:300"/> promiſed dependeth, either in whole, or in part, upon Baptiſme, but may depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Repentance only: unleſs we ſhall conceive (which is not improbable) that in the promiſe of <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> the Apoſtle intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſenſible and preſent fruition and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. Taking the promiſe in this comprehenſive ſenſe, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> may well have a part in the obtaining of it, it having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God (as it were) on purpoſe to give men the fulleſt aſſurance of <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> upon their Repentance (as was lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued.) But otherwiſe, it is a true and uſeful rule, which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> giveth us, where he ſaith, <hi>Neque ſemper conjunctio utranque partem neceſſariò ponit.</hi> P. Mart. loc. com. claſſ. 4. c. 8. ſect. 18, that <hi>a conjunction copulative doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, or alwayes, entitle both the particulars, which it conjoyneth unto the procurement or attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which is promiſed, or aſcribed unto them.</hi> According to this rule he interpreteth the ſaying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born again of water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> with which he paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leleth this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in tbine heart, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> That, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. (pointed at in the queſtion) is of like cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with theſe. Thus when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him which hath ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life:</hi> his intent is not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43506:301"/> to make the <hi>ſeeing of the Son,</hi> of a like neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (nor, indeed of any neceſſity at all) with <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him,</hi> for the obtaining of <hi>everlasting life,</hi> although the tenor and form of the words ſeem ſo to carry it. For after his reſurrection he ſpeaketh thus unto <hi>Thomas, Thomas, becauſe thou beſt ſeen we, thou haſt believed; BLESSED are they that have NOT SEEN, and yet have BELIEVED, John</hi> 20.29. But that <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> ſtrictly taken, is by God ſettled upon <hi>Repentance,</hi> and not at all upon <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what was lately argued in proof hereof, might be evinced from ſundry other paſſages of Scripture. Theſe words are twice uttered by <hi>Chriſt</hi> within the compaſs of three verſes, —<hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 13.3.5. The ſentence is of the like truth, whether we underſtand it of <hi>periſhing</hi> by a temporal judgement, or of <hi>periſhing</hi> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; nor is this latter to be excluded from the words, although it be ſuppoſed that the former was more directly intended. But the ſaying clearly ſuppoſeth, that <hi>Repentance,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> is available to ſave men from <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,</hi> and therefore to obtain <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins alſo, without which, <hi>periſhing</hi> will be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every man. So <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, &amp;c.</hi> See alſo, c. 8.22. The validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Repentance,</hi> without the additional help of Baptiſme, for the obtaining remiſſion of ſins from God, might be effectually argued
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43506:301"/> and concluded yet further from all theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (and haply from more) <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31.11.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5.16.22. And if the caſe were otherwiſe, ſo that <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> could not be had without being Baptized, he that ſhould ſin after Baptiſme, muſt be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the ſecond time (and ſo, <hi>toties quoties</hi>) or elſe remain for ever uncapable of the pardon of his ſin. To pretend, that Baptiſme recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many years before, may operate towards the <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> committed many years after, is to ſpeak at an unheard of peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to think to quench mens thirſt with an empty cup. If it be ſaid, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> at the time when it is received, intereſſeth a perſon in the great bleſſing of the forgiveneſs of his ſins, but if he ſhall ſin afterwards, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to make the beſt he can of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; I would know whether the meaning of ſuch a ſaying be, that it intereſſeth him at the time, and in the bleſſing mentioned, whether he be penitent or repentant, or no. If it be ſaid, he muſt be penitent, otherwiſe he ſhall put a bar in the way of his Repentance, and hinder the working and effect of his Baptiſme; I anſwer, that in caſe he be penitent, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can any man give why he ſhould not be thought to obtain the <hi>forgiveneſs of his ſins,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his <hi>Repentance,</hi> then by his <hi>Baptiſme?</hi> That an impenitent perſon obtaineth <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> by being baptized in his impenitency, is (I preſume) no mans ſenſe or aſſertion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43506:302"/>
                     <p n="2">2. When <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Paul, — Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not ſuppoſe him now to have been in a ſtate of condemnation, or under the wrath of God for ſin, or (which is the ſame) that his ſins were yet unpardoned; (this is clear from the three verſes next preceding.) Therefore when he exhorteth him ſpeedily to be <hi>baptized, and waſh away his ſins,</hi> his meaning only is, that by being <hi>baptized,</hi> he ſhould <hi>typically,</hi> or <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally waſh away</hi> [or <hi>waſh</hi> off the guilt of] his ſins, and ſo receive a pledge of confirmation from the hand of God himſelf that he had forgiven them, or <hi>waſhed</hi> them <hi>away.</hi> It is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture to ſpeak of things as done ſimply, and abſolutely, when they are done ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, or in figure. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>divided the red Sea,</hi> when <hi>he lift up his rod, and ſtretched out his hand over it,</hi> Exod. 14.16.26.27. Thus <hi>Aaron,</hi> when <hi>he ſtretched forth his hand with his rod, over the ſtreams, over the rivers, and over the ponds</hi> [in <hi>Egypt</hi>] is ſaid to have <hi>cauſed frgos to come up on the land, Exod.</hi> 8.5, 6. So when <hi>the Ark paſſed before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael into Jordan, the Lord of all the earth</hi> is ſaid to have paſſed likewiſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3.11. ſee <hi>c.</hi> 8.26. And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Sacramental Bread, he ſaid (in effect) that he gave them <hi>his Body;</hi> theſe words clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying as much: <hi>Take, eat, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is given for you, Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. compared. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaking of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43506:302"/> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs, ſaith, they did <hi>all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> when they drank the material water that came out of the <hi>Rock</hi> 1. Cor. 10.4.</p>
                     <p>If it be replied and ſaid. But if <hi>Paul,</hi> by being <hi>baptized</hi> [that is, by ſubmitting unto Baptiſme] <hi>waſhed away his ſins</hi> typically and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally only, and not really; why did <hi>Ananias</hi> incourage him hereunto, by ſuggeſting unto him, <hi>the waſhing away of his ſins</hi> hereby, and not rather by ſome other argument, or motive?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is a matter of worthy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto him, whoſe ſins are <hi>really</hi> pardoned and waſhed away already, to have them <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> and <hi>ſacramentally</hi> pardoned, and <hi>waſhed away</hi> alſo. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had forgiven the ſins of the woman in ſtory, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37, 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was (indeed) the greateſt and higheſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement of grace, that he was capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on her; yet he judged it not beneath him, or his infinite love and bounty to the woman, to make her a certificate that her ſins were forgiven her; <hi>And he ſaid unto her, Thy ſins are forgiven, v.</hi> 48. He did the like unto the man ſick of the Palſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.2. In like manner, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is (as it were) a certificate written by the hand of God himſelf, reached forth, and offered unto all perſons truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or believing, that their ſins are forgiven them, and they who ſubmit unto Baptiſme, do receive it from him; although many, who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43506:303"/> do receive it, cannot diſtinctly read the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it, notwithſtanding the writing be fair, and legible.</p>
                     <p>Yet after all this, it is not to be denied, but that there is a ſenſe (and this differing too from that formerly mentioned) wherein <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,</hi> together with Repentance and Faith, may be ſaid (at leaſt ordinarily) to make up a compleat title to <hi>remiſſion of ſins.</hi> But neither is this the ſenſe ſo much contended for by thoſe, who being ignorant of the Counſel of God in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> have ſought it above that which is written, where there is ſeldom any thing but fancy and imagination to be found. In the ſenſe we now minde, Firſt, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt ſolemn act, and (as it were) the head of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſion, is, by the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> to be taken for this profeſſion it ſelf, abſolutely, or indefinitely conſidered, as whether it be of a ſhorter, or longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, whether finiſhed and completed by fewer, or more, acts otherwiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Jacob,</hi> frequently ſignifie the whole and entire Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> whatever their numbers are, or ſhall be) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Father of the race. In like figure of ſpeaking, <hi>Eſau, Moab, Ammon,</hi> (with others of like conſideration) are often uſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to expreſs the people deſcending from them (reſpectively) Secondly, <hi>Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> is not to be taken, either for that ſtate or condition, into which a perſon is tranſlated
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43506:303"/> immediately upon his Repentance by having his ſins pardoned, or for the act of God, by which he pardons his ſins upon his Repentance, and hereby tranſlateth him into ſuch a ſtate; but for that act of abſolution, or acquitment from all his ſins, which ſhall be pronounced over him by <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the laſt judgement, of which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, Acts 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which before was preached unto you, whom, &amp;c.</hi> See alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. So then theſe two, <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> thus underſtood, when it is ſaid, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Baptiſme are in ordinary caſes joyntly required as neceſſary for the obtaining of <hi>Remiſſion of ſins;</hi> the meaning is, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſion of <hi>Repentance</hi> by wayes and works, ſuitable unto the nature of it, in caſe a man hath time and opportunity after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to walk in them, (which for the moſt part men have) is as neceſſary to ſalvation, or (which is, in effect the ſame) to the obtaining of a final abſolution from the great Judge in the great day, as Repentance it ſelf. This is nothing but what perfectly agreeth with the tenor and import of all thoſe Scriptures, which either exclude perſons of unholy, and wicked, or unfruitful lives from the Kingdome of Heauen, (which are obvious, and in great numbers) or elſe which require an open
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43506:304"/> profeſſion, and confeſſion of the name, and words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> upon occaſion, as well as Faith in him, unto ſalvation. For this, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 42. <hi>Whether is the uſe of Baptiſme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, by way of Precept, and as a duty in theſe dayes of the Goſpel? ſome conceiving that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging force of the precept concerning it, expired with the times of the Apoſtles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> An anſwer unto this queſtion hath been given in part formerly; namely where we inquired into the grounds and reaſons, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Goſpel was, or well might be, ſet forth by God with Sacramental inſtitutions accompanying it. See what was anſwered to Queſt. 5, 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this chapter. For if the reaſons and ends of theſe inſtitutions, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and relating as much, in matters of ſpiritual benefit, and ſervice, unto us in theſe dayes, as they did, or could do, to thoſe who lived in the dayes of the Apoſtles, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle queſtion to be made, but that the uſe of the inſtitutions is intended by God as well, and as much, for us in theſe dayes, as it was for them. Beſides, <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> (as was more lately argued) being the ſeal of this Goſpel-Covenant (which God hath made with men) <hi>that upon their Repentance, their ſins ſhall be forgiven them,</hi> it may with as much reaſon, or with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs, be conceived, that he hath diſanulled the Covenant it ſelf, as the ſeal of it; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not having appointed another in the place
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43506:304"/> thereof. Again, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is no legal, but an Evangelical Ordinance, and conſequently to be adminiſtred, and practiſed, under the Goſpel, during the miniſtry hereof in the world, might be made evident by the light of many reaſons, were it not a thing evident enough without it. As 1. He was a Goſpel Miniſter, to whom the Counſel of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it was firſt revealed, with a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and charge to publiſh it by preaching, and then to adminiſter it. All the Prophets (ſaith <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 11.13.) and the Law propheſied until <hi>John</hi> [excluſively] meaning, that God by the miniſtry and writings of the Prophets and by the Law recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> inſtructed the world, and more eſpecially the <hi>Jews,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining to his Worſhip and Service, and to their own eternal peace: but in his ſervant <hi>John</hi> he intended to found a new Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, of a more glorious and heavenly import. And that <hi>John</hi> was no Miniſter of the Law, but of the Goſpel, is evident; becauſe he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> as being come into the world; yea, and ſhewed unto ſome his very perſon to be beheld by them. 2. If <hi>Baptiſme</hi> were a legal Ordinance, being an initiating or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory Ordinance, as <hi>Cirumciſion</hi> was, it ſhould binde the receivers of it to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> as <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> according to the Apoſtles Doctrine, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3.) did. 3. It was given down from Heaven unto the world upon the account of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43506:305"/> 
                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for his manifeſtation in the world (a new Rite, or Ceremony, in Religion, or in the Worſhip of God, being as the ſhaking of the Heavens, and an <hi>Item</hi> from God, that he was now about to diſſolve and remove, the ancient frame of his Worſhip, which had been once ſolemnly enjoyned, and ſince approved, and continued by him in the world, from the dayes of <hi>Moſes</hi> until then, for the ſpace of a thouſand five hundred years, and upwards; which great alteration was to be made by the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>) <hi>And I knew him not</hi> (ſaith <hi>John Baptiſt, John</hi> 1.31.) <hi>but that he ſhould be made manifeſt unto Iſrael, therefore am I come, baptizing with water.</hi> 4. If coming into the world upon ſo ſolemn, high, and ſacred an account, as for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, and to ſignifie and give notice of his coming into it it, is not likely, that he ſhould abrogate it, eſpecially after ſo ſhort a continuance of it in the world, as it had from the day of its firſt entrance into it, until the day of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death 5. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by his death, would he after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either have joyned it with Faith it ſelf in the ſame promiſe, wherein he promiſeth ſalvation, as he doth, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved?</hi> or have charged his Apoſtles (with thoſe that ſhould ſucceed them in the miniſtery of the Goſpel, and unto the end of the world) with the adminiſtration of it unto thoſe amongſt whom they ſhould preach the Goſpel, if they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43506:305"/> received it? yet this alſo he did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, BAPTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZING them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To underſtand the word <hi>Baptizing</hi> here, in any improper, or by-ſignification, is repugnant, both to that whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſound rule concerning the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture, which enjoyns the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and proper ſenſe of words, when ever the context, and matter in hand will bear it; as alſo to the judgements of all expoſitors, one or other, ancient or modern, who (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt intelligence that my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing, in conjunction with my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, are able to afford me) have expounded it of <hi>baptizing</hi> with water. 6. The Apoſtles, after the death and reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had a liberty indeed for a time, but (as it ſeems) with limitation unto caſes of much conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and expediency for the Goſpel, to make uſe of legal Rites and Ceremonies, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they were very tender and ſparing in the uſe of them; yea, in ſuch caſes, wherein they apprehended that the Goſpel was like to ſuffer, by the uſe of them; they reſolvedly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. But we finde them very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and earneſt in exhorting and perſwading men unto <hi>Baptiſme</hi> upon all occaſions, that is, upon their firſt converſion to the faith of the Goſpel. Therefore (certainly) <hi>Baptiſme</hi> was no legal Service, or Ceremony, nor numbred amongſt thoſe, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> abrogated by his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43506:306"/> death. 7. (and laſtly) If it were ſuch (I mean, a <hi>legal</hi> Ceremony, and not <hi>Evangelical</hi>) there would be no viſible door of entrance, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſion, no external ſolemnity engaging to a conſciencious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the terms and requirements hereof; whereas there was ſuch a door and ſolemnity as we ſpeak of, (and as we lately ſignified) by which, and through which, men entred upon the profeſſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But that there was a like door of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into, or upon the profeſſion of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel (and conſequently, that this door is ſtill remaining in its place and uſe; for doors are not to be taken away whilſt the houſe is inhabited; eſpecially not by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, without expreſs order from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which, in the caſe before us, is not to be found) and that this door was <hi>Baptiſme</hi> (and therefore, as we now reaſoned, is ſo ſtill) is the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſs Doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have [hereby] put on Chriſt.</hi> As in the morning, a man by ſuch actions which nature teacheth him, putteth on his Cloaths, which he weareth in he day: ſo a perſon at the time of his Baptiſme, and by being baptized, according to the ſignification and import of this action intended, and declared by God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſteth himſelf with <hi>Chriſt</hi> [that is, entreth upon an open and avowed profeſſion of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43506:306"/> Name, Law, and Diſcipline of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherein he ſtands hereby alſo bound to continue all the dayes of his life.] See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 43. <hi>Who, and what manner of perſons are they that may lawfully be baptiz'd?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> All without exception, of both Sexes, who deſire it in caſe there be the leaſt ground of hope that they are in favour with God: yea, and all thoſe alſo, on whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half it is deſired by others (themſelves being uncapable, through want of years, to deſire it) who are in authority over them, and have a right of power to diſpoſe of them.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 44. <hi>Why muſt, or ought thoſe, who are duly capable of being</hi> baptized, <hi>being of years of diſcretion, to give any teſtimony, or ground of hope, that they are in favour with God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We finde from place to place in the New Teſtament, that ſome ſuch teſtimony was inſiſted upon, and required [if it were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given) of thoſe who deſired to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, by thoſe that were to adminiſter the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance unto them: and commonly a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, or Repentance, was in this caſe demanded, becauſe ſuch a profeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in theſe times, when the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> expoſed the Profeſſors to many dangers and troubles) a competent and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground, on which to judge men to be in favor with God, and withal, was the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and proper that could be given ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, or within a ſhort time. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43506:307"/> theſe Scriptures (with their fellows) may at leaſure, be conſulted, conſidered, and compared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.38.41.8.12.37.10.47.18.8. The reaſon why ſuch perſons only are meet to be admitted unto <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> who give ſome reaſonable account of their being in favour with God, is, becauſe Sacramental Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (and this of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in particular) were intended by God, (the great Founder of them) for his own Houſe and Family only, for his Friends and Servants, not for ſtrangers, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or (in the Apoſtles expreſſion) for thoſe that <hi>are within,</hi> not for thoſe that are <hi>without.</hi> They are ſomwhat of a like deſign with the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Ceremonies of old in that notion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, wherein they were a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-wall</hi> between his own people, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the reſt of the world, the Gentiles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. For ſo do theſe Inſtitutions, or Divine Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, diſtinguiſh and divide the holy, from the unclean, the believing, from the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party of the world; at leaſt thoſe that profeſs and pretend to, Holineſs and Faith, from thoſe that neither practiſe, not profeſs either. And they would perform this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and dividing part much more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and exactly, and much more to the honor and advantage of the Goſpel, then now they do, did not men think themſelves, either more charitable, or more wiſe in building Churches, then thoſe maſter work-men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43506:307"/>
[the Apoſtles) at leaſt did they not act in this kinde of work, as if they judged the Apoſtles but novices at it, in compariſon of themſelves: But this by the way. Indeed ſupernatural ſignes, or miracles, when God is pleaſed to unbare his arm in working them, are commonly intended by him for ſtrangers, and unbelievers (in order to their awakening, and converſion by Faith unto him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 2.23.4.48, 6.30, 12.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.6.) But Sacramental ſignes are (as hath been ſaid) peculiarly for thoſe, that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready awakened to a believing in God, or at leaſt profeſs ſo to be. Now why God was pleaſed to appoint, and appropriate Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſignes unto his Churches, and ſo for the uſe and benefit of thoſe, who are by the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> actually reconciled unto him, and in favour with him, a ſufficient account hath been formerly given. See the anſwers to Queſtion 5.6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this Chapter. This then is, or may be, the reaſon why perſons of years, before their admiſſion unto <hi>Baptiſme</hi> ought to give ſome teſtimony of their intereſt in the paternal love and favor of God; or rather, why God hath impoſed this upon them, as a condition, the performance whereof qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth them for the reception of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Other reaſons hereof might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but where the will of God is expreſs, and plain, and nothing found in it diſturbing, or offenſive, to the reaſons, or apprehenſions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43506:308"/> of men, there is the leſs need of them.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 45. <hi>Whether may Infants, or young Children, lawfully be baptized, conſidering that they are not able to give any teſtimony, as either by a profeſſion of their Faith, and Repentance, or otherwiſe of their being in the favor of God; and beſides, there is no record found in the Scripture, that mentioneth the baptizing of any Infant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The controverſie about Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, chiefly through the too-reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs of thoſe who have oppoſed it, but partly alſo by reaſon of the inſufficiency of ſome grounds, upon which it hath been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and likewiſe of the anſwers, that have been given to ſundry of the allegations brought againſt it, by ſome of thoſe, who have undertaken the defence of it, is of late years become (almoſt) boundleſs, and endleſs. That which I judge neceſſary to anſwer (at preſent) to the queſtion propounded, I ſhall comprize within as narrow a compaſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as can reaſonably be expected, and as the opening of my minde in the buſineſs will bear.</p>
                     <p>My ſenſe then in the caſe of <hi>Infant-Baptiſme,</hi> is, that Infants not only lawfully may, or ought to, be baptized, but that they are the moſt proper, and primarily intended ſubject of this ordinance, even as they were of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo (although none but men, or perſons not wanting in years much of men, were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed at the time of the firſt inſtitution of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43506:308"/> it; <hi>Abraham himſelf was</hi> 99. <hi>years old, and Iſhmael</hi> 13. <hi>years old</hi> when they were circumciſed, <hi>and all the men of his houſe, born in the houſe, and bought with money of the ſtranger were circumciſed with him,</hi> Gen. 17.24, 25, 27.)</p>
                     <p>By the way, if it be ſubſtantially proved that they lawfully may be baptized, I judge it but a reaſonable preſumption, or inference, from hence, that they are the moſt proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſme, and that this ordinance was primarily intended by God for them (however men, and women, not having been baptized in their infancy, or in their younger years, ought to be baptized likewiſe, and this with the firſt opportunity, as was practiſed in the dayes of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles; and Circumciſion alſo was, in the dayes thereof, adminiſtred unto men in the like caſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) For if men (and ſo women) might, when and whilſt they were yet children, have been by their Parents, or thoſe that were inſtead of Parents unto them, as lawfully devoted, conſecrated, and given up unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to his Service, as now they have attained unto diſcretion and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they may by a free act of their own, (queſtionleſs) it had been more reaſonable, and more agreeable to the declared will of God in ſuch caſes, that this dedication, or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, ſhould have been made early and in the morning of their dayes, and with the firſt opportunity, then after the delay of many
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43506:309"/> years. For God is wont to require timeous, early, and expeditious applications of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto him, and his ſervants, well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his diſpoſition and deſire in this kinde, have girded up the loins of their mindes, and applied themſelves accordingly. See, conſider, and compare, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.21 <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.60. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20.22.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.23.</p>
                     <p>Now that children, other circumſtances concurring, (as the ſerious and conſcien cous deſire of the Parents, one, or both, or of thoſe, wo are <hi>loco Parentum,</hi> as Guardians, or perſons entruſted with their education, or thoſe that have charitably undertaken, or intereſſed themſelves in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) lawfully may be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, I demonſtrate (firſt) from the ground lately mentioned thus: All perſons of <hi>Adam's</hi> poſterity, being known to be in favor with God, are ſubjects duly capable of <hi>baptiſme,</hi> and may lawfully, other circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, be <hi>baptized:</hi> But children are perſons of <hi>Adam's</hi> poſterity, and known to be in favor with God. Therefore they may, in the caſe mentioned, be <hi>baptized.</hi> The former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that all <hi>perſons of mankinde known to be in favor with God, may lawfully be baptized,</hi> is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for truth by ſome of the moſt learned and judicious in the <hi>Antipaedo-baptiſmal</hi> cauſe it ſelf. <hi>If it could be known</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> or words to the ſame effect) <hi>that children are in the favor of God, I ſhould not doubt but that they might be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43506:309"/> 
                           <hi>baptized.</hi> By the way, he that ſpeaketh and conceiveth thus, clearly granteth and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth (with us) that when Faith, or Repentance, or the profeſſion of either, were required by the Apoſtles, or others, in men and women, that were to be <hi>baptized,</hi> they were not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them in any other reſpect, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but only as being profeſſed, they were a teſtimony (though far from infallible too, and only ſuch, which very poſſibly might, and ſometimes did, deceive them, as in the caſe of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c.) of their being in favor with God. Nor is it lightly imaginable upon what other account they ſhould have been required to make profeſſion of them, in order to their <hi>baptizing.</hi> So that if it ſhall by any other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or proof, appear as certainly [that is, as probably, for there was no higher proof, in a profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, then what was only probable, as was lately hinted, that men and women were in favour with God] that children, or others, are in favor with God, as it could appear by their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith and Repentance, this muſt needs render them ſubiects as regularly qualified for <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as ſuch a profeſſion, were it made by them, ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> The <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf implieth as much, when to ſatisfie <hi>John</hi> about his <hi>baptizing</hi> him, he ſaith to him, <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43506:310"/> RIGHTEOUSNESS,</hi> Mat. 3.15. And yet he made no profeſſion of Faith, or Repentance, nor was he indeed) capable of them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not of the latter, having never ſinned; no, nor of the former in ſuch a ſenſe of the word, <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein believers unto juſtification did, and do at this day, make profeſſion of it. Therefore that which qualified him regularly for Baptiſme, was, his being known, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto <hi>John,</hi> to be in favour with God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a like account the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo cauſed thoſe to be baptized without any more adoe [I mean, without any particular, or ſolemn profeſſion of their Faith and Repentance] un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he perceived that God had given the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, interpreting this as a ſign that they were in favor with God; <hi>Can any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we?</hi> Acts 10.47. Other inſtances of like import might be produced. So that the truth of the major propoſition [that perſons known, or that with probability may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to be in favor with God, may lawfully be baptized] is unqueſtionable. Nor can I apprehend that ſuch men keep company with their principles, who ſubſcribing this truth (as we lately heard that ſome of the leading men amongſt the Anti-paedo-Baptiſts themſelvs do) are yet non-conformiſts as to Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme. For even ſuch a reprobation of, or amongſt children granted, as the Anti-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43506:310"/> party of them ſuppoſeth, yet is there as large a ground of hope (or however, not much leſs) that particular children, eſpecially children of an holy extraction, one, or both of whoſe Parents are truly godly, are in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of God, as that men and women ſhould be in his favor, who make an outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith and Repentance. If it be ſaid, that frequent experience hath ſhewed that the Children of good Parents have proved Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, the anſwer is at hand, namely, that the like experience hath ſhewed the like ſad event and iſſue in many, that have made an oral profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, who notwithſtanding were found <hi>in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and bands of iniquity</hi> afterwards. And though it could be made to appear that there is more hope, that perſons, who having arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at year of discretion, and ſhall make a profeſſion of their Faith, are in favor with God, then Infants lately born, though of godly Parents, and that more ſuch Infants have in time proved Reprobates, then of the others, yet neither doth this prove, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ought not to be baptized, although the other may. For (according to the known rule in reaſon, <hi>Magis &amp; minùs non variat ſpeciem,</hi> More or leſs do not alter the ſpecies, or kindes of things) greater hope, that one perſon is in favor with God, doth not make any ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between him, and another, concerning whom there is ſomewhat leſs hope of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43506:311"/> in favor with him likewiſe, as that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhould be a ſubject duly qualified for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, and not the latter. And for as great a difference of the hope we ſpeak of, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon and perſon, (doubtleſs) it may be, and frequently is, found, even amongſt, and between, thoſe, who make an oral profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, ſome of theſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a better and more ſatisfactory teſtimony of the truth of their Faith, then ſome others. So that they who grant, that a reaſonable and probable hope that a perſon is in the love and favor of God, duly qualifieth him for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,</hi> cannot reasonably deny, but that Children, at leaſt ſome Children (and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, thoſe lately ſpecified, who in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are termed Holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) are thus qualified, and conſequently may lawfully be <hi>baptized.</hi> Yea, all they who grant, and yield, that a vocal and perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, giveth a regular and due title unto Baptiſme (which the whole univerſe of Anti-paedo-Baptiſts do) if they would be ſo ingenuous as to follow their own conceſſions in the caſe, and not notion, or interpret, a <hi>profeſſion of Faith and Repentance,</hi> in the nature of a charm, or a ſpell, but rationally, and ſpiritually, theſe would turn them aſide from the way of their error, and lead them unto <hi>Infant-Baptiſme</hi> (which is the way of the truth) For if a <hi>profeſſion of Faith and Repentance,</hi> doth not qualifie for <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in reſpect of the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43506:311"/> ſound of the words uttered, but as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth, or affordeth a ground of hope, that men and women who ſo profeſs are the children of God, and ſo in favor with him (for in what other conſideration it ſhould ſo qualifie, is not lightly imaginable) then there being a ground of hope, and this altogether as pregnant, that Children are partakers of the ſame grace and favor of God with them, they muſt needs be as regularly qualified for <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as they. Nay, if the regularneſs of a <hi>Baptismal</hi> capacity be to be eſtimated by a reaſonable ground of hope that a perſon is a Childe of God, and in favor with him, young Children have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence at this turn above any, above all, the men and women, that have ever yet made, or ever ſhall make, a profeſſion of their Faith. For as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> argueth, <hi>If we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9.</hi> Children having the teſtimony of God himſelf in the Scriptures (as we ſhall ſhew preſently) that they are in favor with him, and this without any condition, or <hi>proviſo,</hi> whereas the teſtimony which men and women give themſelves of their being in favor with him by profeſſing Faith and Repentance, is (as was lately hinted) very uncertain and fallible, it is a plain caſe that the reaſon and ground of our hope concerning Children, that they are in favor with God, are incomparably more weighty and ſatisfying, then any we have, or can, have, of the like hope concerning
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43506:312"/> men and women. And this conſideration, with ſome others, ſo far prevaileth upon me, that I cannot but judge (as I lately ſignified) that children are the more proper, and the primarily intended ſubject of the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> Nor doth it at all weaken my belief in this kinde, that there is no particular or expreſs command for the baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor yet any ſuch record of any Childe baptized, to be found in the Scriptures. For as God in nature (as the natural Philoſopher obſerveth) is not defective in things that are neceſſary, ſo neither is he redundant in things unneceſſary or ſuperfluous; ſo is it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and meet to conceive, that he obſerveth and walketh by the ſame rules of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, in his Word alſo. Now then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that there are grounds and principles, either clearly laid down in the Scripture, or evidently deducible from hence, which in a rational way lead unto the <hi>baptizing</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as a duty (only the general or indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite commands <hi>baptizing,</hi> together with the ſeveral adminiſtrations here recorded, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) it was no wayes neceſſary that God ſhould any further declare his minde for their baptizing (although it ſtood never ſo much this way) as by any particular or expreſs command, example, or the like. It hath been a true obſervation of ſome, and pertinent to the buſineſs in hand, That for the greater part of the duties in general, which we ſtand
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43506:312"/> bound to perform, yea, and which conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons do perform, are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by any particular and expreſs precept, nor warranted by any the like example; but are enjoyned (in an argumentative and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential way) partly in general commands, reſpectively including them, partly in ſuch principles and grounds, which by the ordinary light of reaſon lead unto the practice of them. It is no where particularly commanded that a woman ſhould partake in the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, nor is ſuch a practice warranted by any example; yet is it more then warranted [I mean, it is charged upon, or required of, that Sex] in the general or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit commands concerning the practice of that duty, in conjunction with thoſe grounds, and reaſons (contained in the Scriptures) for the practice, which indifferently reſpect both Sexes. For though ſome (to avoid the force of this inſtance, making ſo ſtrongly againſt the ſubſtance and effect of all they have to ſay againſt Infant Baptiſme) plead, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For albeit the ſaid

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It doth not alwayes, or neceſſarily, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a <hi>Woman,</hi> wherever it was uſed: places might be cited in great numbers from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, as well as from other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whereby this would be made manifeſt. 2. In very many places of Scripture it ſignifieth determinately an <hi>individuum</hi> of the male Sex, or, a <hi>man, Mat.</hi> 8.9.27.9.8.9.32.10.35, 36.11.8.19.12.10 11.13, (to omit dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and trebble this number of inſtances in the New Teſtament only.) 3d It ſometimes ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a man as contradiſtinguiſhed to a <hi>Woman, Mat.</hi> 19.3.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. So that the Text mentioned (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.) containeth no <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> or <hi>expreſs</hi> precept for womens recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lords Supper. There is no word here that <hi>particularly,</hi> or <hi>expreſly</hi> and neceſſarily ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a woman. And were it not for ſome Scripture grounds, one, or more, from whi h it may be proved that there is the ſame, or the like reaſon, why women ſhould partake of this Sacrament, which there is for men, that place would ſignifie little as to their receiving it; eſpecially conſidering yet further, that the Apoſtle manageth his whole diſcourſe in this place about the Supper in the maſculine Gender only, as appears, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32.33: But ſuppoſe this place ſhould be admitted to paſs, as a particular precept unto women to partake of the Lords
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43506:313"/> Table, yet there will be found no ſuch precept, nor any example, in the Scripture to juſtifie the act of him, that ſhall adminiſter, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Sacrament unto them, but the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (or neceſſity rather, by way of duty) hereof, muſt be argued, or inferred, either from ſome general precept, or from ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or ground, which in a rational, conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and conſequential way require of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſuch an action, as being the will of God concerning them upon occaſion. It is more eaſie then needful, to give inſtance in many more particulars of like conſideration: So that an action or practiſe, may be not only warrantable, and lawful, but even highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by way of duty, when there is neither an expreſs command, nor example, to evince either the lawfulneſs, or neceſſity of it. This for the former propoſition.</p>
                     <p>For the minor propoſition, which affirmeth, that all Children, at leaſt of the Church, and of believing Parents, are in favor with God, it hath both the greater light of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the leſſer light of reaſon, ſhining clearly on it. From theſe two heads of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a juſt volume of diſcourſe might be drawn up in the demonſtration, and defence of it. I ſhall (at preſent) give you a taſte only of the <hi>genius</hi> of the one, and of the other, about the point; reſerving the clearing of difficulties, and anſwering of objections, until we meet with an opportunity of more liberty for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43506:314"/> The Scripture ſpeaketh aloud the truth of the ſaid propoſition, as in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo eſpecially, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one, judgement came upon ALL MEN to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came us on ALL MEN unto juſtification of life:</hi> For <hi>as by one mans diſobedience MANY were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one ſhall MANY be made righteous.</hi> Evident it is, that the Apoſtle from the end of the 14th. verſe to the end of the chapter diſcourſeth the typical reſemblance, or ſimilitude (declaring by the way, and upon the occaſion, the diſſimilitude likewiſe) between the firſt, and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in their reſpective procurements, of evil by the former, of good, by the latter, unto men. That which is moſt obſervable to our purpoſe in the diſcourſe, is, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons reſtored unto an eſtate of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of life, by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſtill made commenſurable and equal unto the number of thoſe, who were brought into an eſtate of condemnation and death by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> both numbers being all along ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and deſcribed as the ſame, and in the ſame words, (as was even now ſhewed) <hi>As by the offence of one judgement came upon all MEN to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon ALL MEN unto juſtification of life.</hi> That <hi>ALL MEN,</hi> in the former part of the verſe, includeth all perſons
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43506:314"/> of mankinde, without exception of any (ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the <hi>judgement</hi> mentioned) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all Infants, or young Children, is no mans doubt, or queſtion, and that that ſelf-ſame expreſſion uſed again in the latter part of it, ſhould here ſo far vary its ſignification, as to exclude far the greater part of mankinde, and ſignifie only an handful of them (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) is too far both from reaſon, and from example (as well in the Scripture, as in other Writers) for any man reaſonably to conceive. Therefore all Infants, whilſt ſuch, and until the committing of acutal ſin, are partakers of the Grace of God vouchſafed unto the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to that of <hi>John Baptiſt, John.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold, the Lamb of God, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away THE SIN of the world.</hi> The <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> by which the whole <hi>world</hi> became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto death, is moſt properly termed, <hi>The ſin of the world:</hi> and the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the Redemption wrought by Chriſt in the extent of it, as well unto the the perſonal and actual ſins of men, as their guilt derived from the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is wont to expreſs it by mentioning <hi>ſins</hi> (in the plural number) not <hi>ſin</hi> (in the ſingular, unleſs it be with a note of univerſality, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more emphatical, and altogether as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, as the plural number: for which ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.79.) but for the other, ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2.3.5.4.10. This Doctrine, that Infants, and young children, are in favor with God,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43506:315"/> might be argued and proved from ſeveral other places alſo, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3.19.14, 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14, 15.9.36, 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16, 17. <hi>John</hi> 8.34. (to omit the reſt) &amp; thoſe texts likewiſe might be as readily anſwered, which are thought by many to oppoſe it, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>job</hi> 14.4. <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. (with ſome others) But we intend not in this work a large diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any thing.</p>
                     <p>In reaſon there is this (amongſt many other things) to confirm the ſaid Doctrine. Some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are in the love and favor of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all are ſo likewiſe. The antecedent in this argument is granted by all, no man (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) affirming, that God hateth, or is an enemy unto all Infants without exception: therefore ſome are in his favor. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is built upon that worthy character, or property in God, which the Scripture from place to place, (with a kinde of emphatical ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity) aſſerteth unto him, I mean, his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.) or, <hi>non-accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>non-reſpecting of perſons.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 10 17. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Job</hi> 34.19.37.23, 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11 <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. Now if God be <hi>no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> but of the cauſe only (for this is implied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by way of antitheſis, and is elſewhere fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and plainly affirmed of him) certain it is, that he ſheweth the ſame reſpects of love, and hatred, unto all Infants; eſpecially that he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43506:315"/> putteth no ſuch vaſt difference between one infant, and another, as his eternally-ſaving love, and his everlaſtingly-deſtroying hatred, do import. For in reſpect of any reaſonable, or equitable cauſe either of love, or hatred, all Infants are every wayes equal; all of them being equally involved in the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, and hereby equally liable to the judgement of God; all of them equally prone, in reſpect of their natures, and of themſelves, unto all evil; all of them equally diſtant from, and equally nigh unto Faith, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and every other ſaving qualification. Therefore if God loveth ſome of them with a love unto ſalvation, and hateth others with an hatred unto condemnation, he muſt needs be a reſpecter of <hi>Perſons,</hi> there being no difference at all, in, or between, the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the one, and of the other, whereon to build that different award of affection. For that the affection, whether of love, or of hatred, which God bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Infants, is not an affection of meer pleaſure, or will, but (as we may call it, for want of a better term) a judiciary affection [I mean, ſuch an affection, which eſſentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth in it a judiciary ſentence, or an award, either of reward, or puniſhment, to be irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably paſſed upon the perſons of theſe Infants, dying ſuch] may be eaſily proved. For the Counſel and Intent of God in the Goſpel, and reſtauration of the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was in a regular and formal proceſs of judgement,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43506:316"/> to declare his goodneſs and bounty in reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe highly, who by the Law of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be found capable and meet to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him; and on the other hand, to ſhew the ſeverity of his juſt diſpleaſure againſt ſin, when found in conjuction with ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impenitency, in the puniſhment of obdurate and final unbelievers. This is a truth viſible enough in the very ſuperficies of the Goſpel from place to place. So then the caſe, and cauſe of all Infants, in reference to their final judgement, being (as we have ſeen) in every reſpect one and the ſame, if God ſhould paſs a ſentence of abſolution and reward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of them, and a ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and death upon others, it muſt needs proceed from his reſpects unto the meer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the former above the later. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments of more of the good things of this preſent world into ſome of them, then unto others; as in health, wealth, proſperity, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endowments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not argue any ſuch affection, either of love, to the one, or hatred unto the other, as that we now ſpeak of, and lately called <hi>judiciary;</hi> becauſe the largeſt meaſure of temporal good things given unto men, (otherwiſe, at leaſt, then after, and for, ſome ſpecial ſervice performed) is not given unto them by way of reward, or by a judiciary award; as neither is a ſcanter meaſure in theſe things, diſpenſed in a way of judgement unto thoſe, to whom this diſpenſation is made (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43506:316"/> haply it be after ſome ſinful provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and with relation hereunto) but both the one diſpenſation and the other, are acts of will and good pleaſure in God, and proceed from him, not as he is the judge, but as he is the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Ruler of the world, and at full liberty to do with his own what he pleaſeth. And though ſometimes in Scripture he is ſaid to <hi>love</hi> thoſe to whom he intends more liberally in outward things; and (on the other hand) to <hi>hate,</hi> where he intends more ſparingly (as in the caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Mal</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13.) yet evident it is, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count lately given, that for ſuch <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> as theſe (with their different fruits, and effects) there is no colour why accepting of perſons (in the diſhonourable notion of the words) ſhould be imputed unto God, becauſe accepting of perſons (in this ſenſe) hath place only in matters of judicature between men, and men; whereas both thoſe affections in God, with their reſpective expreſſions, import only matter of liberty, and what he ſtandeth not ingaged unto by any Rule, or Law, no not of his own (as hath been already declared.) Hereunto this may be added, as not altogether irrelative to the buſineſs in hand: Although <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> be (figuratively, and after the manner of men) aſcribed unto God, as contrary affections (or rather indeed, at leaſt ſometimes, as the ſame affection, diverſified only by degrees, an inferior degree in <hi>love,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43506:317"/> frequently expreſſed by <hi>hatred,</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) in reſpect of their (ſeemingly) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects [the more bountiful, and the more ſparing collations, or donations, of the good things of the world] yet according to the true eſtimate of the caſe, and this ruled by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves, there is not more of that <hi>love</hi> which is ſaving, or of a ſaving tendency in the one of thoſe diſpenſations, then in the other. For upon this account (doubtleſs) it was, that the wiſe man <hi>Agur</hi> deſired Riches of God no whit more then Poverty [<hi>Give me nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poverty, n r riches, Prov.</hi> 30.8.] Certainly if he had apprehended the leaſt degree of Gods ſaving <hi>love</hi> towards him, in his caſting <hi>riches</hi> upon him, above what he conceived in his ſending him either <hi>poverty,</hi> or <hi>food convenient,</hi> he would have deſired it before either of them. But this by the way. However the argument propounded ſtands firm upon its baſis; if God loveth any young children ſavingly, he loveth them all upon the ſame terms, becauſe he is no accepter of perſons; and amongſt them, there is nothing of cauſe to be found why any of them ſhould be differenced in judgement from others, or be juſtified, when others are condemned; or (which is the ſame, in effect) why any ſhould be loved with ſuch an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which carrieth a ſentence of juſtification in it, more then others. This is one reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating the truth of this Doctrine; that <hi>Infants may lawfully be baptized.</hi> I ſhall (at
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43506:317"/> preſent) only ſubjoyn another upon the ſame account.</p>
                     <p>If God before, and under the Law, judged it meet, that men, whilſt they were yet Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhould be admitted into the profeſſion of his Name and Worſhip [or, into his Church] by the door of a Sacramental ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and hath no where declared any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or change of his minde, or pleaſure, touching this, then is it his will and pleaſure that children ſhould be <hi>baptized,</hi> under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as it was that they ſhould be <hi>circumciſed</hi> under the Law.</p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent in this Argument is true; therefore the conſequent alſo: and ſo children are, by the will of God, to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</p>
                     <p>The former part of the Antecedent is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably true. For men, both before and under the Law, were, whilſt they were yet Children, admitted into the Church of God by Circumciſion [or, by being circumciſed] and this by the expreſs order and command of God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. &amp;c. <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.3. Nor is this (I ſuppoſe) denied by any. The latter part is no leſs certain.</p>
